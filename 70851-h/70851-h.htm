  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>In dedicating this book to you, I have no choice of words; the
memories of a helpless and feeble childhood crowd too closely on my
heart for that. From the day when you received me an infant from the
arms of a dying sister, down to the calm twilight of your own most useful
life, I have a remembrance only of more than motherly kindness and
entire affection. My childhood and my youth, with all their joys and
tender griefs, are so beautifully blended with thoughts of your household
virtues and maternal love, that it is impossible to realize that even partial
orphanage was ever known to me.</p>

<p class='c011'>I once hoped to blend with yours the name of that honored father,
who has but lately laid down the burden of almost fourscore years and
ten, and gone forth from the faithful affection which surrounded him
here, to the more perfect love of heaven. But my father is dead, and
in the holy welcome of angels the voice of his own child is hushed.
Still, through the golden chain of your love, my mother, this dedication
shall yet reach him. With you—who made his old age tranquil almost
as the heaven he approached, who went faithfully down to the valley
of the shadow of death, giving him up only to the angels that waited
there—I leave this homage, that it may be conveyed to him through
your nightly prayers.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER I.<br> <span class='large'>THE FIRST GIFT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>It is my mother’s story that I am about to write—the story
of her young life, her wrongs, her sufferings, and the effects of
those wrongs, those sharp sufferings as they flowed in fire and
tears through my own existence. Her history ran like a destiny
through my own. My life is but a prolongation of hers.
I have but done what she would have accomplished, had she
not been trampled down like a broken flower, in the civilized
life with which none of her blood or race could hope to mingle
and live.</p>

<p class='c014'>She was a gipsy of Granada. You may search for her birthplace
among the caves that perforate the hill-side to the right,
as you gaze down upon Granada from the Alhambra. That
hill, honeycombed with subterranean dwellings, and its bosom
swarming with human beings, was my mother’s home. Beggars—yes,
call them so—a people born to delude and prey upon all
other races, these were her companions. She was a gipsy of
the pure blood, not a drop, not a taint had ever mingled with
the fiery life that glowed in her veins.</p>

<p class='c014'>Men call me beautiful. And so I am. But compared to my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>mother, as I remember her, that which I possess is but the light
of a star as it pales into the morning, contrasted with the same
bright jewel of the sky, when it burns pure and undimmed in
the purple of the evening. I have, it is true, eyes like hers,
long, black, almond shaped; but English blood has thrown a
soft mistiness upon their lightning. My cheeks have a rich
bloom; but hers were of a deeper and more peachy crimson,
glowing out through the soft creamy tint of her complexion
with a warmth that shames comparison. See, I can shake
down my hair, and it falls over me like a mantle rolling in
heavy black waves far below my waist; but hers swept to the
ground. I have seen her bury her tiny foot in the extremity
of those raven curls, and press them to the earth while she
stood upright, without straightening a single tress. As for her
person, you could liken it to nothing of human beauty. An
antelope—a young leopardess, an Arab steed of the pure blood—these
were the comparisons that flashed to the mind as you
watched the movements of that lithe form—those delicate and
slender limbs. Imagine, if you can, a being like this, wild as a
bird—utterly untamed, her veins burning with that lava fire
that seems caught from another world, her every movement an
inspiration. Imagine this creature at fourteen years of age
roaming beneath the old trees that lie at the foot of the
Alhambra, and earning a scant subsistence with her castanets,
and her native dance, from the few foreigners who brave the
discomforts of Spanish travel to visit the Alhambra.</p>

<p class='c014'>She was always among those beautiful old trees, haunting
them like the birds for shelter and subsistence. Sometimes you
might have found her crouching beneath a thicket half asleep,
and dreamily listening to the silvery flow of a hundred concealed
rivulets, introduced by the Moors into these shady walks.
Sometimes she would lie for hours on the banks of the river
that flows through the outskirts of these woods, and weave garlands
from the wild blossoms so abundant there, crowning herself
like a May Queen, and using the waters for a mirror, the
only one she had yet seen. But in all this seeming idleness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>she was ever upon the alert, listening for the sound of wheels,
peering through the trees for a view of any chance traveller
that might ascend to the ruins on foot; in short, feverish with
anxiety to earn bread for her old grandmother, who waited
hungrily for it in the caves that yawned upon her from the
opposite hill.</p>

<p class='c014'>One day, when my mother was a little less than fourteen,
full-grown as most females of that age are in Spain, yet delicate
and slender as I have described, she had come to the Alhambra
woods with two or three gipsy girls of her tribe, but wandered
away alone as was her habit, searching for wild flowers to compose
a garland for her hair. Down in a little hollow that sinks
abruptly from the broad avenue leading to the Alhambra, she
found a profusion of these sweet stars of the wood, and began
to gather them in handsful, forming a drapery from her scant
calico robe, and filling it with the fragrant mass in pleasant
wantonness, for she had collected blossoms enough to crown half
Granada.</p>

<p class='c014'>She sat down on the ground, and selecting the most dewy
buds, began to weave them into a wreath, blending the tints
with a degree of taste that would have been pronounced artistic
in civilized life. Red, yellow, purple with delicate and starry
white blossoms, all flashed through her little hands, blending
themselves, as it were, by magic into this rustic crown. Now
and then she paused and held the garland up admiringly with a
smile upon her lips, and her graceful head turned on one side,
half shyly, like a bird’s, as if she were ashamed of admiring her
own work.</p>

<p class='c014'>Her castanets lay upon the grass, and stretching one little
naked foot, plump as an infant’s, down to the rivulet that
flowed by her, she began to dip it up and down in the sparkling
water, carelessly as a bird laves itself in the morning.
As the waters rippled over that little foot, breaking up in
diamond drops all around, she continued her sweet task, leaning
on one side, or bending backward now and then to gather
some green sprig or fresh bud that grew within reach.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>My poor, poor mother—how little could she guess that the
moment so full of sweet repose, while the waters sung and
whispered to her as they passed, while the blossoms breathed
balm all around, gratifying her senses and her delicate taste
at the same moment—how could she guess that moment to
be one of destiny to her, the single speck of time on which
all her after life depended!</p>

<p class='c014'>She kept on with her pretty garlands, blending with unconscious
taste, a little delicate green, and a few white bells with
the rich clusters of crimson, yellow, and blue that predominated
there.</p>

<p class='c014'>When it was finished, she withdrew her foot from the water,
that it might not disturb the pure surface—watched the bubbles
with a smile as they floated downward, and, bending over
the rivulet, wreathed her garland among the rich folds of hair
which I have mentioned as so glossy and abundant.</p>

<p class='c014'>A knot of scarlet ribbon—I know not how obtained, but
it was her only finery, poor thing—fastened this floral crown;
and after arranging her dress of many-colored chintz, she
regarded herself in the water for an instant with smiling
admiration. And well she might, for the image thrown back
by that tranquil pool was full of picturesque beauty, unlike
anything you ever dreamed of even in romance.</p>

<p class='c014'>A slight noise, something rustling among the neighboring
foliage, made her start from that graceful half-stooping position.
She looked eagerly around—and there, upon the upper
swell of the bank, stood a young man looking at her.</p>

<p class='c014'>My poor mother had no thought but of the coin she might
earn. A cry of glad surprise broke from her lips, and seizing
her castanets she sprang from amid the litter of wild flowers
that had fallen around her feet, and with a single bound
stood before the stranger, poising herself for the national
dance.</p>

<p class='c014'>I cannot tell what it was, but some strange magnetic
influence possessed my mother. As her slender limbs were
prepared for the first graceful bound, her spirited ankle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>strained back, and one little foot just ready to spurn the turf,
a wonderful fascination came over her. She stood a moment
immovable, frozen into that graceful attitude, her eyes fixed
upon the stranger’s, her red lips parted in a half smile, checked
and still as her limbs. Then the eyelids, with their long,
thick lashes, began to quiver, and drooped heavily downward,
veiling the fire of those magnificent eyes. The tension slowly
left her muscles, and with the castanets hanging loose in her
hands, she drooped languidly toward the youth, as a flower
bends on its stalks when the sunshine is too warm.</p>

<p class='c014'>He addressed her in English, but, though she did not understand
his words, the very sound of his voice made her shiver
from head to foot. He spoke again and smiled pleasantly,
not as men smile with their lips alone, but with a sort of heart-bloom
spreading all over the face. She looked up, and knew
that he was asking her to dance; but she, whose muscles
up to that moment had answered to her will, as harp-strings
obey the master-touch, found all her power gone. She could
not even lift her eyes to meet the admiring glance bent upon
her, but shrunk timidly, awkwardly—if a creature so full of
native grace could be awkward—away, and burst into tears.</p>

<p class='c014'>That instant there came leaping up from a neighboring
hollow, the half dozen gipsy girls that my mother had forsaken
in the woods. On they came like a troop of young
antelopes, leaping, singing, rattling their castanets, and surrounding
the stranger with smiles, gestures, and sounds of
eager glee.</p>

<p class='c014'>He looked around, surprised and smiling. The scene took
him unawares. His heart was brimful of that sweet romance
that hovers forever like a spirit about the place, and this
picturesque exhibition startled him into enthusiasm. It was
like enchantment. The wild poetry of the past acted before
him. His dark grey eyes grew brilliant with excitement.
He smiled, nay, even laughed gaily, scattering silver among
the troop of dark browed fairies that had beset his way.
There was something eager and grasping in the manner of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>these girls as they scrambled for the money, pushing each
other aside with lightning flashes of the eye, and searching
avariciously among the grass when all had been gathered up.</p>

<p class='c014'>You could see that the young man was very fastidious from
the effect this had upon him. A look of disappointment,
tinged with contempt, swept the happy expression from his
face; and when they began a new dance, less modest than
the preceding, he motioned them to desist. But they were
not to be driven away; he had been too liberal for that.
They drew back a little, but continued to dance, some moving
around him on the avenue, others choosing the turfy bank.
Still he beckoned them to desist, but misunderstanding his
gestures, they became subdued, threw a more voluptuous spirit
into the dance, and the languor that tamed down each movement
seemed a portion of the balmy atmosphere, so subtle
and enervating was the effect.</p>

<p class='c014'>But the stranger was no ordinary man. The very efforts
that would have charmed others, created a singular feeling of
repulsion in him. He turned from the dancing girls with a look
of weariness, and would have moved on; but disappointed in
the result of the last effort, they sprang into his path like so
many bacchantes, making the soft air vibrate with the rapidity
and force of their movements. Half clothed—for the garments
of these young creatures reached but little below the knees,
their slender limbs and small, naked feet exposed in the wild
frenzy of their exertions, eager as wild animals who have
tasted blood—they beset his way with bolder and more desperate
attempts to charm forth a new supply of coin.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the midst of this wild scene, the young man chanced to
turn his eyes upon my mother. She was standing apart, not
drooping helplessly as at first, but upright, spirited, with a curve
of invincible scorn upon those red lips, and a blush glowing
like fire over every visible part of her person. For the first
time in her life, she seemed to be aroused to the character of
her national dance: for the first time in her life the young
gipsy had learned to blush.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>The Englishman was struck by her appearance, and made an
effort to draw near, but his wild tormentors followed close, and,
to free himself, he adroitly flung a handful of small coin far up
the avenue. Away sprang the whole group, shouting, leaping,
and hustling each other about, as they cleared the distance
between themselves and the Englishman.</p>

<p class='c014'>He approached my mother with a little reluctance, such as a
man feels when he tries a new language, and uttered a few
words in Spanish.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why do you remain behind? There is money up yonder,”
he said.</p>

<p class='c014'>My mother looked up. The tears which she had suppressed
still sparkled on her curling eyelashes.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I do not want money,” she said; “I have done nothing to
earn it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And why did you not dance with the rest?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I don’t know. It seems to me now that I never have
danced like them, and yet, I tried to begin that very dance—tried
and could not.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The blush again burned on her face. She made a movement
as if to cover it with her hands, and desisted, ashamed of her
new-born modesty.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And why could you not dance for me as you have for
others?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I do not know.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You have already earned money enough?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I have an old grandmother who has not tasted food to-day.
She is waiting in patient hunger till I shall bring money from
the woods to purchase it. My companions will carry food to
their parents—mine must wait.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“See, I have driven these people away. They did not please
me, but you shall give me a dance while they are busy. Here
is a piece of good English gold, which will supply your grandame
with food during the next fortnight.”</p>

<p class='c014'>My mother took the gold and examined it with great curiosity.
She had never seen so much money at once in her life.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>“I—I am to dance before you, and this will be mine?” she
said, at last.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, it will be yours!”</p>

<p class='c014'>She handed him back the money, took up her castanets, and
stepped forth with a sort of haughty grace. Giving her person
a willowy bend sideways, she began, the tears starting afresh
to her eyes as she made the effort. But the elasticity seemed to
have forsaken her limbs: she stopped abruptly and retreated.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I will not go on,” she said; “I don’t want the piece of
gold; I only know the dances that made you drive my companions
away.”</p>

<p class='c014'>There was no acting in this. My poor mother literally
could not perform her task, and it was this very failure that
charmed the young Englishman. Had she earned the money
it would have been given, and she possibly remembered no
more; as it was—ah, would to heaven she had earned it—earned
it and gone on her way true to her people—true to the
blood that never mingles with that of another race without
blending a curse with it.</p>

<p class='c014'>But there was something in my mother’s refusal that interested
the Englishman. He was very young, only in his twenty-fourth
year, but of mature intellect and strong of mind. Still
the fresh and romantic delicacy of youth clung to his feelings.
They were both fresh and powerful. The ideal blended with
all things. He could never have been a slave to the mere
senses, but sensation excited, his poetical nature made even
that exquisite. He was not a man to indulge in light fancies,
but his imagination and his feelings were both strong, and in
these lay the danger.</p>

<p class='c014'>Love is the religion of a woman educated as my mother had
been. In her it seemed like apostasy from the true faith to
allow her heart a moment’s resting-place out of her own race.
Indeed, she deemed it an impossibility, and thus secure, was
all unconscious of the fatal passion that had transformed her
very nature in a single morning.</p>

<p class='c014'>Not half an hour had elapsed since my mother had met
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>the stranger. The dew that trembled on her coronal of wild
blossoms still glittered there; the first footprint she had made
upon the grass that morning still kept its place. Yet how
much time it has required for me to give you an idea of the
feelings that grew into strength in that brief time—feelings
that vibrated through more than one generation, that made
me what I am; for this man was my father.</p>

<p class='c014'>Be patient, and I will tell you more; for there lies a long
history between that time and this, the history of many
persons; for did I not say that my life was but a continuation
of hers? And I have known much, felt much, suffered. But
who that has known and felt, can say that he has not suffered?</p>

<p class='c014'>“Nay, you have fairly earned the gold,” said the Englishman,
bending his now bright and earnest eyes on my mother,
with an expression that made every nerve in her body thrill,
as if it had been touched to music for the first time—“take
it for your grandam’s sake, my poor child!”</p>

<p class='c014'>What charm possessed my mother? She who had been
among the most eager when money was to be obtained—why
did she shrink and blush at taking the gold from that
generous palm? Why, when she happened to touch his hand
in receiving it, did the warm blood leap to each finger’s end,
till the delicately curved nails seemed red with some artificial
dye? The gold gave her no pleasure at first. It seemed a
sacrilege to receive it from him; but after a little it grew
precious as her own life. Her grandmother went hungry to
bed that night, for the gipsy girl would not part with this
one piece of gold. She did not even acknowledge to any
one that it had been given her, but hid it away close to
her heart, and kept it there through many a sharp struggle
that broke that poor heart at last. I have it in my bosom.
It was necessary at times that I should feel it grating cold
and hard, or something of tenderness would have crept there.
I could not have gone through with all that I had to accomplish
but for this gold—gold, gold. It is a fine thing to harden the
heart with; in many ways men have found it so.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>My mother took the money, then, with a faint blush and
a smile that lighted up his face into absolute beauty, the young
man said,
“I see you hesitate; you will not believe the money is fairly
earned. Now to set you at rest I will take the wreath you
wear as full compensation. It will remind me hereafter of my
first day at the Alhambra.”</p>

<p class='c014'>My mother smiled, and her face kindled up with the pleasure
his request had given. She unbound the wreath and presented
it to him, ribbon and all.</p>

<p class='c014'>That ribbon was the only ornament that she had in the
world, but she parted with it joyfully; though the diamonds
that Queen Isabella sacrificed to Christopher Columbus were
not half so precious to their owner as this scarlet snood had
been to the gipsy girl.</p>

<p class='c014'>I have the ribbon too. That piece of gold is suspended
to it about my neck—the first gift of my mother—the first
gift of my father. He wore the ribbon around his neck at
the death-hour. The gold also; alas! it was an awful hour
when that piece of gold was laid in my palm.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Englishman lingered for weeks at the Alhambra. He
lived at a little Fonda that stands close beneath the ruins,
sometimes spending whole days among the old Moorish remains,
at others wandering thoughtfully beneath the stately trees.</p>

<p class='c014'>My mother had spent her life in those woods. She could
not change her habits now, for the love of those cool shadows
had become a want of her whole being; but she danced the
gipsy dances and sung the gipsy songs no more. Her companions
wondered greatly at this, and triumphed over her
with a wild glee that would have roused her indignation a
few weeks before. Now, she turned from them with a quiet
curve of scorn upon her lip, and stole away by herself, weaving
garlands, and listening to the hidden waters that chimed
their sweet voices in the solitude, whispering a thousand
dreamy fancies, which deepened almost into sadness as time
wore on.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>I know not how often she saw the Englishman during that
period. Not very frequently, I am sure; for she had become
timid as a fawn, and would sit crouching among the thickets
for hours, only to see him pass distantly through the dim veil
of the forest leaves.</p>

<p class='c014'>Night after night she went home from the woods empty-handed,
and musing as if in a dream. Her grandame chided
her sharply at times, for hunger made her stern. The gipsy
girl bore this with surprising meekness, weeping gently, but
never urging a word in her own defence, save that she did
not know why, but it was impossible to dance as she had done;
the strength left her limbs whenever she attempted it.</p>

<p class='c014'>A week—more than one—went by, and the gipsy girl remained
in this inactive, dreamy state. Then a sudden change
came over her. She grew animated, the wild passions of
her nature kindled up again. You could see that her heart
slept no longer. The dove that had brooded there so sweetly
had taken wing. She went to the Alhambra early. She left
it sometimes after dark, often bringing a little money which
she gave the old woman with trembling hands and downcast
eyes, that were frequently full of tears.</p>

<p class='c014'>At this season you could not have looked upon her face
without admiration. The bloom upon the sunniest peach suffered
in comparison with the rich hues of her cheek. Her eyes
were starry in their brightness. You could not speak to her
without bringing a smile to her mouth, that brightened it as
the sunshine glows upon ripe strawberries. If tears sometimes
started beneath these thick lashes, they only served to light up
the eyes they could not dim, for every bright drop seemed to
leap from a blissful source.</p>

<p class='c014'>She was quiet though, and said little. You only knew how
exquisite was her happiness by the glorious beauty of her
face.</p>

<p class='c014'>Then, all this exquisite joy went gradually out, as you see
a lamp fade when the perfume oil burns low. She wept no
more blissful tears. Her smile grew constrained, and took a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>marble paleness. It was singular that no one observed this;
that the keen-eyed people of her tribe never suspected what
was going on in that young heart—but so it was.</p>

<p class='c014'>One person of the tribe would not have been thus blinded;
for he loved the gipsy girl as only the wild, strong nature of
the pure blood can love; but he had gone to attend the annual
fair at Seville, and my mother was left to the tempter and
her own heart. Much that passed during this time remains
a mystery even to me, her child, for in the manuscript that
she left, there is hesitation, embarrassment—many erasures
and whole sentences blotted out, as if no language could satisfy
her—or, as if there existed much that she could not force
herself to write. Still, she seemed to linger about this period
as if afraid to go on. It was her first love-dream; how could
she describe it? Her first step in the crooked way which
no human being can possibly make straight. How could she
describe that to her own child? Still, much was written, much
revealed, that I shall put into form. For my mother was a
child of the Alhambra, and there her destiny commenced shaping
itself into a fate.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER II.<br> <span class='large'>THE SIBYL’S CAVE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>I have spoken of the grandame who was my mother’s only
relative. I have a sort of fierce pride in this old woman, and
love to trace the Rommany blood that burns in my own heart,
back to that weird source; for in her withered veins it grew,
like old wine, strong with age and bitter with the hate which
our people bore to the Gentiles.</p>

<p class='c014'>Learned men still cavil about our origin. They gather up
scraps of our language, they ferret out our habits, and torture
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>our tradition to establish the various theories, which, after all,
must remain theories; for ours is a poverty-stricken people.
We have no possession, not even a history. They call us
a nation of thieves, and say that even our traditions are stolen.
Be it so! at least we are faithful to each other, a boast which
the brotherhood of civilization cannot honestly make.</p>

<p class='c014'>But though wise men have traced us back to Judea, and
made us worshippers of idols, we who worship nothing in
heaven or on earth, know by the secret sympathies that link us
together—sympathies which no Gentile can comprehend—that
the blood within our hearts is of another source than the idolaters
of Judea.</p>

<p class='c014'>They say that our traditions are stolen from your Bible;
that from the solemn prophecies written there, we have gathered
up a belief in our Egyptian origin. But my great grandmother
never looked into your Bible. She would have trampled the
falsehood under her feet and spit upon it, had any one hinted
that in the Gentile language, lay the great secret of her race.</p>

<p class='c014'>But her faith in the Egyptian descent of our people was like
a religion. How it came to her, whether from tradition, fable,
fact, or those sorcerers’ arts that made her famous among all
our nation, I do not know. Save in those wild sympathies that
knit our tribe together, as with bonds of iron, all over the
earth, our people have no history. They came like a cloud of
locusts sweeping down from the East. It may be one of the
curses sent forth to infest the earth after ravaging Egypt. It
may be a fragment of the lost tribes. It may be even, as some
of our traditions say, that we were sent forth as a punishment
for inhospitality to the mother of God and her holy child.
There is a wide field for conjecture. Let your wise men guess
on. With us, our Egyptian descent is a faith—all the religion
that we have!</p>

<p class='c014'>I know many languages, am learned in historic lore—learned
in the great foundation of all history, the Bible. Of that which
pertains to my people I have studied long and deeply; yet as
my great grandmother, the Gitana, believed, so do I. To her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>occult wisdom, her subtle sympathies, I have brought all the
knowledge to be gathered from the literature of other races.</p>

<p class='c014'>I have searched your sacred book till my soul has been
stirred to its depths with the dark prophecies that foreshadow
the scattering of our tribes over the face of the earth. I find
the destiny that is now upon us written out in that great book,
certain, unmistakable as the thunder-cloud that heralds in a
tempest. There is wisdom in that book. Our people should
know it better, for much of its grandeur came from Egypt, as
we did—Egypt the great mother of learning—the land which
gave its wisdom to Moses, and taught the irresolute how to
think, act, and suffer.</p>

<p class='c014'>And we too are of Egypt. Does the Gentile want proof?
Let him search for it in the prophecies that he holds sacred.
Let him read it in the voluptuous character of our dances, in
the unwritten poetry, unwritten because it grows tame and
mean in any language but the Rommany. The Gitanos speak
their poetry as it swells warm from the heart, for it would
grow cold in the writing. Let him search for it where he pleases.
We require no proof, better than the mysterious spirit within
us. Our hearts turn back to the old land, and we know that it
once belonged to us.</p>

<p class='c014'>My great grandame was no common Gitana. Her husband
had been a chief, or count, among the gipsies, during his
entire manhood. This was no common dignity, for our people
choose their own leaders, and it is seldom that one man’s popularity
lasts during a life-time. The Gitano chooses his wife for
her talent, her art, her powers of deception; in short, for what
you would call her keen wickedness. These are the endowments
that recommend the Gitana bride to her lord. It was
for these qualities, joined to talents that would have given her
a position in any nation, that my ancestor married his wife.</p>

<p class='c014'>This great grandame of mine was bravely descended, and
richly endowed. Talent descends most frequently from the
mother, and through the female line she could trace her blood
back to that arch sorceress, who wound herself around Maria
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>de Padilla, during her heroic life, and in the end betrayed that
noble woman to death, when she fled from Toledo with her son.</p>

<p class='c014'>Maria de Padilla had offended our ancestress, and she was
true to her hate. My great grand-dame wore a pair of ear-rings,
massive gold circlets set with great rubies. In her
poverty—for in the end she became very poor—these antique
ornaments were always about her person. No amount of suffering,
no temptation could win them from her, even for a
moment. These antique rings had been wrested from the
heroine of Toledo, on the night when she <em>disappeared</em> with her
Gitana attendant. There was a tradition, that the precious
stones with which they were beset, had once been white, but
that after the murder, had changed to the blood-red hue which
they ever after maintained. I know not how this superstition
took birth; but the craft of our Gitana ancestress seemed to
descend with the rings, as they came down from that wonderful
creature, always through the females, to the old Sibyl who
was the grandame of my mother.</p>

<p class='c014'>I know that the Gitanos are considered as impostors; that
they are supposed to practise their arts for coarse gain, and
for that only; but this is not always true. No devotee ever
put more faith in her saint than the gipsy, who has long exercised
her powers of divination, places in the truth of her mysterious
art.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was late in the evening, and old Papita—for thus my
ancestress was named—sat in her cave-home waiting the return
of her grand-daughter from the Alhambra. Perhaps upon the
whole earth there is nothing more repulsive than a very old
woman in any portion of southern Europe. The voluptuous
atmosphere, the warm sunshine that matures female life so
early, seems to mock its own precocious work, by proving how
hideous time can render it. But if age makes itself so repulsive
among the luxurious women of Spain, those who scarcely
draw a breath of that delicious atmosphere which is not heavy
with fragrance, how much more hideous must be the old age of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>a Gitana hid away in the dark hollows of the earth, with rude
and insufficient food, clothed in rags, uncared for, held in no
higher repute than the foxes who burrow in the earth like
themselves, and are scarcely held apart from civilization more
than they are?</p>

<p class='c014'>There was something witch-like in the appearance of my
great grandame as she sat alone in her cave that night. A
meagre candle shed its light in sickly flickers around a rude
niche scooped in the rock, from whence the entire dwelling was
cut. The body of this light fell upon the old woman’s head,
kindling up a scarlet kerchief that she wore, somewhat in the
fashion of a Moorish turban, into vivid brilliancy; but casting
the rough features into blacker shadow, till they seemed meagre,
dark, and almost as withered as those of an Egyptian mummy.
Her claw-like hands were folded over her bosom, and a ring
set with some deep green stone cut with Egyptian characters,
caught the light like a star; for the setting was of rough massive
gold, that seemed heavy enough to break the withered
finger, that it covered from joint to joint. A few embers lay
upon the stone floor at her feet, the remnants of a fire that had
burned low, leaving a thin cloud of smoke still floating in the
vaulted roof of the cave.</p>

<p class='c014'>A low chair of heavy carved wood, the antique plunder of
some religious house, served the old woman for a seat; and
before her, upon the embers, stood a small bronze vessel, which
gave forth a soft odor as its contents simmered sleepily in the
dying heat.</p>

<p class='c014'>Besides these objects, there was little of interest in the
dwelling. The cave was scooped from the soft sandstone cliff
that forms one side of a ravine, through which the Darro
passes before making its graceful sweep around the Alhambra.
The walls and ceiling were blended together in a thousand
irregular curves and angles, roughly chiselled, and blackened
over with smoke. It had no particular form; but sunk into
recesses; was cut up into hollows; bulged out in places that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>should have been corners, and had a dozen angles that promised
some definite form, but failed in the performance.</p>

<p class='c014'>In size it might have covered eighteen or twenty square feet.
The floors were of stone, like the walls, for all was cut from one
rock; but smoke and long use had so disguised the native
material, that it could hardly be guessed at. A few dried
herbs were hung in one hollow of the wall; an earthen pot,
full of fresh flowers, stood in another; some specimens of coarse
pottery occupied a shelf opposite the door, and cooking utensils
of heavy iron were huddled in a corner, making the shadows in
that portion of the cave still more dense.</p>

<p class='c014'>The old Sibyl arose, took down the candle, and holding it
over the bronze vessel peered into it, muttering to herself.
Now the dark mummy-like aspect of her features changed; the
eyes, black, firm and large, for age had no power to quench
their lightning, illuminated those withered features and gave
expression to every wrinkle. Her thin lips parted, and through
a weird smile, that made them writhe like disturbed serpents,
shot the gleam of her sharp, long teeth, white as ivory, and
strong as those of a tiger.</p>

<p class='c014'>My great grandame in her youth was of middle size; but
age had contracted her muscles and warped her sinews, leaving
her limbs spare and lean till she was scarcely larger than a
child of twelve years. Her head was singularly large, the
forehead heavy, the eyes under it burning like coals of living
fire; and this disproportion was exaggerated by the heavy red
kerchief that I have already spoken of.</p>

<p class='c014'>As the old woman lifted her person from its stooping position
and rose upright, you wondered that she had power in
those withered limbs to stand so erect, or carry the weight of
that heavy blue saya, with its succession of crimson flounces all
edged with golden lace, from which the brightness had departed
years ago. You wondered, too, at the picturesque and singular
arrangement of colors in her dress. It is true the old velvet
jacket had lost all traces of its original lustre. The colors of
the saya were dimmed and worn away; but the vestige of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>former dignity was there, and no age could injure that mystic
seal, or the massive ruby rings that bent her thin ears with
their weight, and flashed like great drops of blood falling from
beneath her kerchief.</p>

<p class='c014'>Two or three times the grandame waved her light over the
bronze vessel, then thrusting the candle back into its niche,
with an air of discontent she walked to the door of her cave,
flung it open and looked out.</p>

<p class='c014'>At first she held one hand over her eyes as we do when the
sun strikes us suddenly, and no wonder, for what a contrast
was that beautiful night with the black hole she had left!</p>

<p class='c014'>I have seen the Alhambra by moonlight, from the very point
of view which the old Sibyl commanded, and it is one of the
memories which one would give up years of life rather than
surrender. Down from the soft purple of that glorious sky fell
the moonlight, pouring its rich luminous floods over the snows
that lie forever upon the noble mountain ranges of the Alpujarras.
It cast a silvery halo around each snowy peak, making
the whiteness lustrous as noonday, then came quivering down
their sides, and fell in a silvery torrent among the groves that
girdle the Alhambra. There, subdued and softened by the
masses of foliage, it divided a sweet empire with the night,
leaving half those dim old towers to the shadows, and pouring
its whole refulgence upon the rest, throwing a glory over some
broken arch, and abandoning its neighbor to obscurity.</p>

<p class='c014'>Ah me, there is nothing on earth so beautiful as the moonlight
shining amid a grim old ruin like that. It is the present
smiling away the gloom of the past.</p>

<p class='c014'>Broken up, as it were, by those naked old towers, the light
fell among the groves, throwing the trees out in masses that
took a greenish hue almost as if it had been day; then the
foliage became dense, and long shadows cast themselves like a
dewy vapor down the hill, admitting soft gleams to flicker in
here and there, like a network of pearls embroidering the darkness.
Then, as if some undercurrent of light had been all the
while flowing on beneath the trees, out rushed the moonbeams
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>breaking away from the shadows, and pouring down upon the
bosom of the Darro, smiling, sparkling, kindling up every drop
of water as it flowed by, till you would have thought some hidden
vein in the mountains had broken free, and a torrent of
diamonds were sweeping between Granada and its Moorish
fortress.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is possible that the old gipsy saw nothing of this. I am
inclined to think that she did not, for the scene had become
familiar to her, and that night she was ill at ease. Instead of
turning her gaze as you would have done upon the Alhambra
and the snow ridges beyond, she threw her head back, and
began peering among the stars, muttering to herself in some
strange tongue, and holding up her mystic ring as if to catch
direct fire from the particular star to which her eyes were
uplifted.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Not now,” she said fiercely; for the least untoward thing
awoke the old woman’s wrath; and even then she longed to
gather all that beautiful moonlight up, and cast it into some
dark void, because its refulgence dimmed the stars which she
wished to read. “Not now,” she muttered, locking her sharp
teeth together, and turning her fierce eyes upon the sky with
a gleam of hate—“not while the moon is wading through the
snows up yonder, and putting out the bright, beautiful stars till
the heavens all run together like the printed pages of a book
which one has not the art to read. Not yet, not yet. I must
wait till the skies are purple again, and the stars come out
with fire in them. The moon, the moon, it is the friend of the
Busne, never of the Gitana. Accursed be its path in the sky.
May the stars, that have a language for the Egyptian, grow
powerful, and smite it down from its high place.”</p>

<p class='c014'>After uttering this weird curse, the Sibyl closed the door
and slunk back into her cave, pacing to and fro, and crooning
over a wild snatch of song that seemed to excite rather than
soothe the fierce mood she was in.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER III.<br> <span class='large'>CHALECO AND HIS PLUNDER.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>All at once the old woman drew in her breath with a hiss,
and bent her eyes on the door. She heard a footstep approach.
The wooden lock moved, and a man perhaps of twenty-three or
four years old presented himself.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was many years since the old Sibyl had been known to
change countenance, or the unpleasant surprise that seized her
at the sight of this man must have been visible. Yet of all
his tribe he might have been deemed a welcome guest in any
cave in the settlement, for he was a count or chief among the
gipsies of Granada, and added to this, was the betrothed husband
of Aurora, the grandchild of Papita.</p>

<p class='c014'>Why then should the old woman shrink within herself
and receive Chaleco, the chief of her tribe, with so much
inward trepidation? I only know that, dazzled as her eyes
had been by the moonlight, she had read enough in the stars to
make her afraid of meeting Chaleco.</p>

<p class='c014'>The young count had all those strongly marked characteristics
that distinguish his race: a clear olive complexion; heavy
voluptuous lips, revealing teeth that shamed the whitest ivory;
hair black and coarse, but, in his case, with a purple lustre
upon it; eyes of vivid blackness, and cheek bones slightly; in
him, very slightly prominent, all lighted up by an expression of
great strength, sharpness, cunning and perseverance—that is,
these passions must have been visible in his countenance had he
ever allowed one true feeling to speak in his face. His dress
alone would have bespoken his position in the tribe to one
accustomed to the habits of our people, still it did not entirely
appertain to the portion of the country to which he belonged.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>Chaleco had travelled much in Catalonia, and having a rich
fancy in costume, adopted many of their picturesque habits of
dress. On this evening, he seemed to have arrayed himself
with peculiar care, which is easily accounted for when we
remember that he had been more than six weeks absent from
Granada, and in that time had not seen his betrothed.</p>

<p class='c014'>With the deep cunning of her race, blended perhaps with
a little of the irritation that had preceded his coming, Papita
was the first to speak; and taking exception to the Catalonian
fashion of his dress, fortified her own position by commencing
hostilities before the young man had time to ask questions,
which she felt herself unable to answer satisfactorily.</p>

<p class='c014'>“So, Chaleco, you have come back at last, and more like
a stranger than ever. What Busne has bewitched you in the
fair at Seville, that you return to Granada in a dress like
that?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why, mother, this is all folly. I have but added this
cap to the garments that I wore when we went from hence.
Surely this is not a thing to provoke your wrath,” cried the
young man, taking a scarlet cap from his head with that half-shy,
half-defying look with which some men receive female criticism
on their dress, and grasping it with the heavy tassel of blue
silk in his hand—“Aurora will not condemn it so sharply, I
dare say.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The mention of this name seemed to embitter the old woman’s
reply.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is a Moorish cap, no true Gitano would wear it,” she
said, eyeing the unfortunate cap with a contemptuous glance,
“and your dress of dark blue velvet embroidered at the neck—pockets
with gold upon the seams—silver buttons and tags
rattling from their rings—and chains over your bosom like
the bells around a mule’s neck.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Nay, you can find no fault with the buttons; they are
from the best silver workers of Barcelona,” cried the count,
flinging open the short dark velvet jacket with sleeves, which
he wore hussar fashion over this beautiful dress, and revealing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>his whole person with an air of bravado, which the more
swarthy color on his temples belied.</p>

<p class='c014'>The old woman glanced with an expression that she intended
to be one of unmingled scorn, upon the embroidered strips of
cloth, blue and yellow, that enriched the neck and elbows of
the young Gitano’s jacket, and allowing her eyes to glance
down to his well-turned limbs, terminated her gaze at the sandals
laced up to the knee by many-colored ribbons.</p>

<p class='c014'>The young man followed her glance with a half-shy, half-provoked
look.</p>

<p class='c014'>“At any rate, you cannot find fault with this, or this,” he
said, drawing her attention to a rich scarf of crimson silk
around his waist, and a handkerchief in which many gorgeous
colors were blended, that was knotted loosely around his well-formed
neck. “I can only remember seeing the gipsy count,
your husband, once when I was a boy, but I know well that he
wore a dress not unlike this that you revile so, with a scarf and
kerchief that might have come from the same loom.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The old Sibyl kindled up like an aged war-horse at the
sound of a trumpet—her withered features worked, her sharp
eyes dilated, a grim smile crept over her lips.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, yes, I remember, and it is this that fills my heart with
bitterness. He wrested these things from our foes, the Busne.
They were his portion of the spoil. He laid many an ambush,
and reddened his knife more than once for the frippery which
you get in easier ways; for every button that he wore, his people
had some gain of their own to show. How is it with you,
Chaleco?—how many of our people have been fortunate, that
you are tricked out so bravely? How many mules did you
shear in Seville, to earn what is upon your back?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Aurora would not taunt me so,” said the gipsy, with a
fierce gesture, “if she did”——</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, what then?” rejoined the old woman, sharply, though
her fierce eye quailed a little, and a quick ear might have
detected something like terror in her voice.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why, then,” said the young man, “I would send word that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>the ton of sweetmeats in which we shall dance knee deep at
our marriage festival, should be kept back; and I would fling
this chain of gold, which shall lace up her wedding bodice, into
the Darro. It is because you are old and learned—the widow
of a great count, that I have borne all these gibes so tamely;
no one else in the tribe should revile me thus. <em>She</em> least of all.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Either the stern tone which the young man assumed, or his
praise of her dead husband, softened the austere temper of the
old woman. Perhaps it might be the unwonted sight of that
gold ornament, or what is most probable, her attack upon the
young man had been an artful scheme to gain time, till her
grand-daughter should appear. Certain it is, her face took an
expression less in character than the wrath had been with her
weird features. A crafty, sly expression stole into her eyes;
her mouth stirred with a slow smile, moving sluggishly as the
worm creeps. She reached out her hand for the chain, and
letting it drop to a heap in her palm, bent over it with a look
of gloating avarice that would have been hideous to any one
but the Gitano, who had witnessed these scenes from his birth.</p>

<p class='c014'>The old woman looked suddenly up. A fierce light was in
her eyes.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The rings in my ears are red hot; the chain burns in my
palm; I know the sign; the Busne has been forced to give up
his gold once more. Our people have not altogether sunk
down to be mere trimmers of mules and donkeys. You did not
work for this, my Chaleco!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Hush!” said the gipsy, lifting his finger with a smile, in
which terror and triumph was blended, “the Busne may be
hanging about our caves. The chain is for Aurora. She shall
wear it upon her bosom on our wedding day. But where is
she? Your sharp words have driven her from my mind!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, no, my son, it is well that we are alone; you have
accomplished a great deed—a deed worthy of Aurora’s grandfather,
he who has stained many a rood of soil with Busne
blood—but times have changed since he roamed the hills with
our people. If there was blood—and the gold burns my palm
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>as if it had been baptized—they will be on our track, hunting
you into our holes as they do the foxes. Tell me how it all
happened; my heart burns to hear; the tidings have filled these
old veins as with wine; I had begun to be ashamed of my people.
Sit down, Chaleco, here, on the old chair which he took
from the choir of their proudest cathedral while the priests
were chanting mass. You never sat in it before; but now
that you have reddened your finger nails—warmed my palm
with gold that is not worked for, the seat is yours. Sit down,
my son, while I draw close, that we may talk!”</p>

<p class='c014'>The young gipsy sat down, but evidently with some impatience;
and the Sibyl creeping close to his side, placed herself
on a low bench, and, bending forward, fixed her glittering eyes
on his face.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Now,” she said, rubbing her thin hands together, and
chafing the chain between them, “tell me, is this all? The
chief takes one third of the whole, that is the law of the
Cales.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, there was gold, a thousand pieces, packed away upon
a mule.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“A thousand pieces! Oh, my son, I saw great luck in the
stars for you—but a thousand pieces!—this is wonderful!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Besides, there was a watch with double case, all fine gold,
and some rings which were too large for Aurora’s finger, so we
buried them in the ground, with the gold and other treasures.
Here is something. I am not sure about giving this to her, these
glittering things on the back may be of value. I found it hung
to the Busne’s neck by the chain; here is his own face, it may
yet bring us into trouble. Look”——</p>

<p class='c014'>The chief drew a locket from his bosom shaped like a cockle
shell. The whole outside was paved with pearls swelling into
the several compartments. The scalloped edges were bright
with diamonds of great value. He touched a spring, and
within this exquisite trinket two miniatures were revealed.
One was that of a young man, fair, with a bright, clear complexion,
fine eyes of greyish blue, a delicate forehead, pure as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>snow in color, and teeming with thought; a mouth somewhat
full, and of deep coral red, with a fair curling beard of rich
brown, kindled up by a tinge of gold; hair a little deeper in
tint, but with the same metallic lustre breaking through its
heavy waves. This was the face, fair, animated, and lighted
up with a beautiful smile, that first presented itself to the old
Sibyl’s gaze. She arose, took down the candle, and peered
over it in silence. The contrast was striking, that tawny,
witch-like countenance, and the beautiful shadows smiling out
from its bed of jewels.</p>

<p class='c014'>There was a female portrait on the other side; but it was
that of a woman somewhat older than the youth could have
been; but, though of different complexion, there was one of
those indefinite resemblances between the two faces which exist
independent of features, running through families, and connecting
them in the eyes of the beholder with a subtle influence,
as one feels that a rose is near, by the perfume which is itself
impalpable.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Sibyl only glanced at the female face, and turned to
that of the young man again with keener interest. You could
see by the workings of her face that she was beginning to hate
that beautiful shadow; for there was a terrible gleam in her
eye when she closed the shell with a snap, and clutched it in
her hand.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No,” she said, sharply, “my grand-daughter shall not wear
this thing. The bright sparks are diamonds; the white ridges
are of oriental pearls. But the face is that of the Busne; it does
not belong to Spain either; hair and eyes of that color come
from beyond sea. It is worth more than all your gold or the
other trinkets; but she shall not wear it. I saw a face like
this between me and the stars to-night. Was the man you
plundered like it?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It was himself; two faces were never more alike!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And your knife, is it red? Did you leave him in the
hills?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, mother,” replied the chief, blushing, as if ashamed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>that he had no crime of blood to confess, “he made no resistance;
we were many, he nearly alone, for the guards fled as
we rushed upon them. We did not kill him, there was no
reason in it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“How long was this ago?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It was three days after we left Granada!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“That is almost six weeks—but where?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“About half way between this and Seville!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And did you take the plunder along?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“We buried it on the spot; went to the fair as if nothing
had happened, and dug it up as we came home.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And which way went the traveller?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“We did not wait to see; his face was toward Granada
when we met him; that is all I can say.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Go from my sight—you should have killed this viper—he
was crawling this way.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mother!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Go—go, but first let me grind this thing to powder with
my foot; help me to spoil his face; you can pick up the
diamonds from the dirt when I have done stamping on them!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, mother, it is worth money—give it to me!”</p>

<p class='c014'>The old woman unclutched her hand and flung the trinket
against the wall of her cave, where it fell back with a rebound
to her feet.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Leave it,” she said, with a fierce laugh, “the thing is
accursed—leave it and go.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Not till I have seen Aurora,” said the young man, looking
wistfully at the jewel. “It is late, very late, she must be
yonder in her nest, ashamed to come forth without a bidding
from her betrothed. Step aside, mother, I have waited too
long.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The young chief strode forward as he spoke, and touching
a door which was half concealed behind the old woman’s chair,
flung it open, revealing, by the light that stood in its niche
close by, an inner room, in which the outline of a low bed and
some furniture was visible.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>“Aurora,” said the young man, “come, come, I have waited
long.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“She is not there,” said the old woman, in a low voice, while
her head drooped downward.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Not there? Nay, nay, I know better, she is only shy,
hiding away like a young fox. See if I do not find her.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He snatched the light and went into the little sleeping cell.
The bed was there, covered with fine old chintz. A little table
and two chairs stood in their several places. The scent of
fresh flowers filled the cell, which, by its cleanliness, its little
ornaments, and the fragrance that floated on the close air
proved that its occupant was no ordinary woman of her tribe.
But everything was silent. No sparkling eyes full of mischief,
no wild laugh met the young gipsy as he expected. He stood
a moment with the candle held up, gazing around the room;
then a painful thought seemed to strike him. He turned and
fixed his eyes on the old woman.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Where is she?”</p>

<p class='c014'>It was all he said, but there was something fierce in the
question.</p>

<p class='c014'>“She went to the Alhambra this morning, and has not come
back yet.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The old woman did not lift her eyes as she spoke; why,
she herself could not have explained; but every time that
night, when word or thought had turned to her grandchild,
this strange cowardice seized her.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I will go seek Aurora,” said the young gipsy, striding
towards the door.</p>

<p class='c014'>“<em>You!</em>” cried the old woman, springing like a tigress between
him and the entrance. “Would you break the betrothal?
Would you cast shame on my blood? Would you
have the whole tribe hooting at you both?”</p>

<p class='c014'>The chief hesitated. He knew well that the gipsy law prohibited
the act he meditated. That for a betrothed pair to
wander alone, or arrange a meeting beyond the confines of the
settlement, would sunder them forever. He thought of this and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>hesitated. But the hot blood of a jealous nature was on his
forehead; he could hardly restrain himself.</p>

<p class='c014'>“With what man of our tribe does she wander at this time
of night?” he demanded, fiercely.</p>

<p class='c014'>“With none; she has scarcely spoken to man or woman of
our people since you left for Seville,” replied the old woman,
with a look of earnest truth that could not but appease his suspicions
in that quarter.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But she is not alone?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I do not know; travellers are plenty in the Alhambra just
now!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Travellers!” repeated the chief, with a scornful laugh, and
the hot blood left his forehead—“the Busne, ha! ha! why not
say this before—the little fox, she is at her work there. Aurora
is a wife worthy of your count, old mother; hers are the eyes
that draw gold from the Busne. But now that I have come
back, she must not stay out so late; I would look in her eyes
myself, the sly one. Tell here so, mother—at daylight I will be
here again.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Relieved from the sharp feeling of jealousy that had at first
possessed him, the gipsy count strode away content and happy—a
little disappointed at not seeing his betrothed that night,
but rather proud than otherwise, that she was employed in
wiling gold by her sweet arts from the people whom it was his
duty to hate. The idea that there could be danger or wrong to
him, in her adventures with the white travellers it was her duty
to delude, never entered his mind. To him, in common with the
whole tribe, the idea of an attachment between a gipsy maiden
and one of another race was an impossibility. Had my old
grandame said that Aurora was out gathering flowers, he
might have been less proud, but not better satisfied. The idea
of being jealous of a Gentile, a Busne, was impossible.</p>

<p class='c014'>But my grandmother was of a different nature. She possessed
that rare organization which is called genius in civilized life, and
magic with us; that exquisite sensitiveness of nerve and thought,
which took the shadow of coming events long before they become
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>a reality. This, with her acute wit, her sharp observation,
her strange habits of solitary thought, rendered her a wonderful
being. It is impossible for me to describe this. I can no more
tell you why my grandame possessed the power of <em>feeling</em> what
was about to happen, than I could divide the elements that
sparkle in a cup of water, but the truth was there. She fancied
that her knowledge came through the stars. But in natures
endowed like hers, there is something more wonderful than all
the stars of heaven can reveal.</p>

<p class='c014'>What was it that induced her that night to fill that bronze
vessel with those strange poisonous herbs? Why did she watch
them distill so sadly, and yet with such stern patience? What
would the juice of these herbs become? I will tell you another
time. Now let us follow my grandmother. She was old, feeble—for
years she had not been known to walk half a mile. But
that night she went forth alone, creeping down the hill-side,
through the hollows along the river’s bank—up, up, like some
hungry animal that dared to prowl through those ravines only
at night-time. She was almost bent double at times, and looked
in truth like a wild animal, but her purpose was strong, and that
carried her forward.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER IV.<br> <span class='large'>THE MIDNIGHT RAMBLE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>A forest of lilies seemed to have poured both whiteness and
fragrance upon the moonbeams as they fell, softly as the flower
breathes, on the grim towers and fairy-like courts of the Alhambra.
It was not very late, but all about the ruins lay
still as midnight. The nightingales had nestled down to sleep
among the roses, leaving the air which they had thrilled with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>music to the mysterious chime of hidden brooklets, the bell-like
tinkle of water-drops falling into unseen fountains, and the faint
ripple of leaves and roses, as they yielded their voluptuous
breath to the night winds.</p>

<p class='c014'>The sounds that came from the distant city but served to
render this solitude more complete. The baying of dogs, the
low tinkle of guitars, the faint, hive-like hum that rose up from
the dim mass of buildings, seemed all of another world. A
spirit looking down upon earth from beyond the stars, could not
have felt more completely isolated than a person wandering in
the Alhambra after the nightingales were asleep.</p>

<p class='c014'>Whatever of human life had been hanging about the ruins
that day should have disappeared long ago, for travelling was
not so common as it is now, and few persons chose to seek the
Alhambra after dark. But on this night there was a sound
now and then breaking the stillness—the tread of footsteps
wandering about the ruins. You heard them at intervals with
long pauses, and from various points, as if some one were
roaming about within the very walls of the palace.</p>

<p class='c014'>This sound had continued some time. It issued first from
that beautiful double corridor which was once the grand entrance
to those enchanting scenes, that even in ruins have more
than the fascinations of romance. Time, that has dimmed their
first loveliness, but leaves broader scope for the imagination,
which, starting from these vestiges of beauty, rebuilds, creates,
becomes luxurious. Contrast, too, has its share; the bleak,
almost rude severity of those grim towers, the weeds, the
broken stonework, the walls tracing the uneven slopes of the
hill, the ruined defences, all give a force, and brighten the
exquisite grace of that little Paradise, which takes one by surprise.</p>

<p class='c014'>Well, the footsteps, I have said, came from this corridor,
once the thoroughfare of kings. Then they were heard from
the gorgeous saloon on the right, composing a portion of those
apartments in which the Moorish Sultanas spent their isolated
lives. Then these footsteps moved towards the great tower of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>Comares, and two shadowy forms appeared moving slowly,
almost languidly, between the slender columns and azulejo pillars
of a gallery that leads that way.</p>

<p class='c014'>These persons—for two were walking close together, and
with footsteps so light that those of the female seemed but an
echo of the harder and firmer tread of the man—these persons
were not wandering in that heavenly place, you may be certain,
from a desire to examine the wonderful beauty that surrounded
them. They had looked a thousand times on those singular
remnants of art. Besides, the gallery was almost wrapped in
shadow, and the rich colours, the lace-like stucco, the dim gilding,
were all flowing together unveiling the darkness, but
nothing more.</p>

<p class='c014'>They hurried on, for the dome of heavy wood that overhung
them seemed gloomy and portentous as a thunder-cloud. The
shadows within those noble carvings were black as ebony. The
beautiful design, the long, graceful stalactites, honeycombed
and dashed with gold, all breaking out as from the midnight of
ages, had a sombre effect. It seemed, as I have said before,
like a storm-cloud condensed over them, full of gloom and prophetic
wrath. My parents had come forth in search of joy,
light, beauty—things that would harmonize with the ineffable
happiness that overflowed their own young hearts—and they
hastened from beneath this frowning roof, with its marvel of
art, its grim antiquity, as we flee from the chill of a vault to the
warm sunshine.</p>

<p class='c014'>Other persons might have lost themselves in this labyrinth of
beauty, but my mother had trod those ruined halls before she
could remember, and the darkness was nothing against her entire
knowledge of the place. Now she stood in that miracle of
beauty, the Hall of the Ambassadors, the grand Moorish state
chamber which occupies the entire Comares Tower. They were
no longer in darkness, for through the deep embrasures of its
windows came the moonlight, falling upon the pavement in long
gleams of radiance, and flowing over the rich colors like the
unfolding of a silver banner.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>It fell upon the walls with their exquisite tracery heavy in
themselves, but so refined by art that the golden filagree work
of Genoa is scarcely more delicate, and snow itself less pure. It
gilded the azulejos. By this I mean those exquisite little tiles,
brilliant as the richest enamel, of various tints—blue, red, and
yellow predominating—which inlaid a gorgeous recess in the
wall, and glittered around that raised platform which had
been the foundation of a lost throne, now glowing in gorgeous
masses, as if precious stones had been imbedded in the snow-work.
All this was so richly revealed, so mistily hidden, that
with a full knowledge of all which the shadows kept from view,
the imagination would take flight, and you felt as if the gates
of Paradise must have been flung open, before even a glimpse
of so much beauty could be given to mortal eyes.</p>

<p class='c014'>For a moment even those two lovers, in the first sublime
egotism of passion which was destiny to them, stood hushed
and dumb as they found themselves beneath the dome of that
wonderful chamber. It was before the present ribs of wood
and masses of intricate carving were introduced, with all their
elaborated gloom, to brood over the most graceful specimen of
art that human genius ever devised. The original dome
arched above them seventy feet in the air, pure, majestic, gorgeous,
as if the gold and crimson of a sunset sky were striving
to break through the masses of summer clouds centred there.
Then they became accustomed to the light, and things grew
more distinct. The glorious moonlight of southern Europe is
so luminous—the darkness that it casts so deep—it leaves no
beauty unrevealed—it gathers all deformity under its shadows.</p>

<p class='c014'>Every beautiful line of art that surrounded them was not
only revealed, but idealized. The noble stucco work within the
dome, moulded into exquisite designs two feet deep, pure as if
cut from the snow ridges of Alpujarras—the ground-work of
gorgeous colors, red, blue, gold glowing out from those depths
of woven whiteness—the long, delicate stalactites dripping with
moonlight, and peering downward from the compartments of
each deep interstice, as if the snow-work, beginning to melt,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>had frozen again into great icicles—the pure whiteness all
around, the colors burning underneath, or breaking out in rich
masses like belts of jewels near the pavement—all this, as I have
said, made even the lovers tread across the chamber cautiously
and in silence. The stillness, the glow, the moonlight, made
even the stealthy tread of their footsteps a sacrilegious intrusion.</p>

<p class='c014'>They stole into one of the deep recesses of a window, where
the moonlight fell upon them full and broad. The walls were
so deep that it gave them a sort of seclusion. They began to
breathe more freely, and the deep spell that had rapt their
hearts for an instant, gave way to the rich flood of happiness
that no power on earth could long hold in abeyance.</p>

<p class='c014'>They stood together in the recess, but with a touch of art—for
entire love has always a shyness in it, a sort of holy reserve,
which is the modesty of passion—Aurora’s eyes were turned
aside, not exactly to the floor, but she seemed gazing upon the
beautiful plain of Granada, which lay like a stretch of Paradise
far below them. He was looking in her face, for there was
something of wild beauty, of the shy grace which one sees in a
half-tamed bird, which would have drawn the eyes of a less
interested person upon the gipsy girl, as she stood there with
the radiant moonlight falling upon her like a veil. As she
looked forth a shade of sadness fell upon her face, singular as
it was beautiful, for in her wild life the passions seldom found
repose enough for that gentle twilight of the soul, sadness.
But it was both strange and lovely, that unwonted softness, the
first sweet hush of civilization upon her meteor-like spirit.
Still he could see her eyes glitter through those curling lashes,
thick, long, inky as night, but nothing could entirely shut
out the wonderful radiance of those eyes.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What are you looking at so earnestly, my bird?” said the
young man, reaching forth his hand as if to draw her closer to
his side.</p>

<p class='c014'>But she hung back, and for the first time seemed to shrink
from him.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>“Will you not speak? Are you afraid of me, Aurora?”
he added with a tone of feeling that changed her face in an
instant.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Afraid! no, no—that is not the word—but this moment,
something came over me as I looked upon our fires up the
ravine yonder. It seems as if every cave were full of light this
evening, and our people—my people—were rejoicing over something.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, child, and what then? Why should this make you
shrink away from me thus?” questioned the young man, smiling
gently upon her as he spoke.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It may be over <em>his</em> return.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She spoke the word with a sort of gasp, and of her own
accord crept close to his side, drawing a deep breath as he
folded her with his arm.</p>

<p class='c014'>“<em>His</em> return! Of whom do you speak, little one?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Of—of Chaleco,” faltered the gipsy child.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And who is Chaleco?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Our chief—the Gipsy Count of our people—the husband
they have given to me!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“The husband they have given to you!” cried the young
Englishman, flinging aside his arm, and drawing back—“the
husband, Aurora!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Aurora started back, even as he did, for she was not a woman
to be spurned, child and gipsy though she was. She did not
speak, but her eyes flashed, and her lips began to curl. She
was a proud wild thing, that young Gitana; and the fire of her
race began to kindle up beneath the love that had smothered it
so long.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Aurora, why did you not tell me of this earlier? How could
I think it—you, who in my own country would yet be so
mere a child—how could I dream that you were already married?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I did not say that,” cried the young girl, and her eyes became
dazzling in the moonlight, so eager was she to make herself
understood. “It is not yet—he, Chaleco, my grandmother,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>all the tribe say that, it must be—and I know that he is to hurry
home the sweetmeats and presents from Seville.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“The sweetmeats? What have sweetmeats to do with
us?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Nothing, I dare say; perhaps you do not use them; but
with us there is no marriage without sweetmeats, a ton or more.
I heard Chaleco say once that he would dance knee deep in them
when I become his—his”——</p>

<p class='c014'>She broke off, and her face became dusky with the hot blood
that rushed over it, for the Englishman, spite of his anger and
of his sharp interest in the subject, burst into a fit of merry
laughter.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why do you laugh?” she said, with trembling lips—“does
it please you that they will marry me to Chaleco—that my life
must end then?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What do you mean, Aurora? I never saw you weep, but
your voice seems choked with tears. Tell me what is this trouble
that threatens us? What is it makes you weep, for I see
now that your eyes are full, that your cheeks are wet? Come
close to me, darling, say, what is it? Not my foolish laughter,
I could not help it, child, the idea of dancing one’s self into
married life through an ocean of sweetmeats was too ridiculous!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It may be,” said Aurora, gently, for the tears she was
shedding had quenched all her anger. “It does not seem so to
us, but then a poor child who cannot help fearing death a little,
when she knows that the grave lies beyond all this, it may well
trouble her.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“The grave, Aurora!—what has driven you mad? The
grave for you, my pretty wild bird? Nay, nay, leave this sort
of nervousness to our fine ladies at home. Here it is pure nonsense.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Hush!” exclaimed my mother, and her eyes flashed like
lightning as she turned them around the vast chamber. “That
was a sound; surely I heard some one move.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I hear nothing,” said the young man, listening and speaking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>low. “It was a bat probably, flitting across the dome—these
things are common, you know”——</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, yes! but yonder the shadows are moving.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I see nothing!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But I did,” whispered the young girl, wildly, “I did!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It might have been something sweeping between the moonlight
and the window,” suggested her companion, who, quite
ignorant of any great danger in being watched, felt little anxiety
about the matter.</p>

<p class='c014'>“This was no cypress bough, no bat trying its wings in the
night. Such movements are common here, but they do not chill
one to the soul like this—see!”</p>

<p class='c014'>The gipsy placed her little hands in those of the young man,
and though she clasped her fingers hard together both her
hands and arms trembled till they shook his.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What does all this mean, Aurora?” he questioned, earnestly.
“I thought nerves were only for fine ladies.”</p>

<p class='c014'>There was a slight sarcasm in his voice, but the girl did not
seem to heed it. Her great wild eyes continued to roam over
the ambassador’s chamber, and she listened, not to him, but for
something that seemed lurking in a distant corner of the room.
At length she drew a deep breath as if inexpressibly relieved,
and lifted her eyes to his again.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is gone,” she said, smiling uneasily—“it is gone!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What is gone?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I don’t know, but something has just left this room: I can
breathe again.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Did you see any one depart?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Did you hear it?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then how could you be certain?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I <em>felt</em> it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“How?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Did you never feel certain of a presence which you neither
saw nor heard?”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>“I do not know; perhaps yes,” replied the young man,
thoughtfully; “the atmosphere of a particular person sometimes
does seem to enwrap us, but this is visionary speculation.
I did not think these vagaries could haunt a wild, fresh, untaxed
brain like yours. They have hitherto seemed to me purely the
result of an over-refined intellect.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It seemed to me as if my grandmother were close by,” said
the gipsy.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Your grandmother! I thought she never left her cave—her
home!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I know that—she could not reach this place—you must be
right. But why should the bare thought have made me tremble
if she was not here—I who never tremble, at least from
dread?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And if not from dread, what is the power that can make
you tremble?” inquired the youth, bending his mischievous
eyes smilingly upon her.</p>

<p class='c014'>She did not speak, but the little hands, still clasped in his,
began to quiver like newly-caught ring-doves. Those wonderful
eyes were lifted to his, luminous still, for all the dews of her
young soul could not have quenched their brilliancy—but so
flooded with love-light, so eloquent of the one great life passion,
that the smile died on his lip. There was something almost
startling in the thought that his hand had stricken the crystal
rock from which such floods of brightness gushed forth. He
felt like one who had, half in sport, aroused some sleeping spirit,
which must henceforth be a destiny to him—an angel or a
demon in his path forever.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You almost make <em>me</em> tremble,” he whispered, bending forward
and kissing her upturned forehead softly, and with a sort
of awe. “Come, love, come, let us walk; this still moonlight
lies upon us both like a winding-sheet.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, yes, let us go,” cried the gipsy eagerly, and gliding
down the spacious hall, the two moved on, seeking that exquisite
colonnade from which the Moors commanded a view of
the whole valley and plain in which Granada stands. Now all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>was darkness. The slender marble shafts blended and bedded
in with coarse mortar, were scarcely visible. The moonbeams
broke against the rude walls, and fell powerless from the beautiful
arches which they had once flooded with silvery light; but
the lovers walked on through all this gloom reassured, and
with their thoughts all centred in each other once more.
Aurora forgot her fears, and he was not of an age or temperament
to yield himself long to gloomy fancies.</p>

<p class='c014'>At length they entered a small chamber, still in good repair,
and flooded with a moonlight which swept through the delicate
columns of a small balcony or temple that jutted from the outer
wall. The pavement seemed flagged with solid silver, the
moonbeams lay so hard and unbrokenly upon it, and received
these exquisite shadows as virgin ivory takes the soft traces of
an artist’s pencil. The glow of rich fresco paintings broke out
from the walls, brilliant as when the colors were first laid on
by order of that Vandal Charles. In the soft scenic obscurity,
the deformity or mutilations of time were unseen. You missed
the frost-like Moorish tracery from over that bed of colors,
but scarcely felt the loss amid the misty gorgeousness that replaced
it.</p>

<p class='c014'>They passed through this room and went out upon the
marble colonnade. Nothing but the delicate Moorish shafts I
have mentioned stood between them and the beautiful plain of
Granada. Lights still sparkled in all directions over the old
city, as if heaven had sent down a portion of its stars to illuminate
a spot that so nearly resembled itself. The gentle undulations
of the plain were broken into hills and ridges of the
richest green. The soft haze blended with the moonlight
where it lay upon the horizon. The mountains that overlooked
all this, on the left, were cut up with ravines full of black
shadows, green as emerald at the base, glittering with snow at
the top.</p>

<p class='c014'>Close by was that belt of huge dark trees, sweeping around
the old fortress, with glimpses of the Darro breaking up through
the dusky foliage—on the right, a dim convent nestled among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>the hills, and nearer yet, the vine-draped ascent of Sierra del
Sol, with its mountain villa, its Darro waters, its orange terrace,
and rose hedges, all filling the sweet night with melody
and fragrance! Do you wonder that they forgot themselves?—that
they looked on a scene like this filled only with a delicious
sense of its beauty?</p>

<p class='c014'>The air was balmy with fragrance, yet cool from the mountain
snows, invigorating, and still voluptuous. The entire
stillness, too—nothing was astir but the sweet, low sounds of
nature, the rustle of myrtle thickets, the mournful shiver of a
cypress tree as the wind sighed through it, the movement of a
bird in its nest.</p>

<p class='c014'>Is it strange, I say, that all this beauty became food to the
love that filled their young lives with its first tumultuous emotions?
That while they forgot that love, and thought only of
the scene before them, it grew the stronger from neglect?
When they did speak, it was in low tones, and as if a loud
word might disturb the entire happiness that reigned in each
full heart.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Aurora, you have been here many times before, and at this
hour, perhaps—say, have your eyes ever fallen upon the scene
when it was beautiful as now?” murmured the young man,
dreamily.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I do not know; I have seen it a thousand times, but never,
never felt that it was really beautiful. To-night it seems as if
I had just been aroused from sleep—that all my life has been
one dull stupor. I shudder at the remembrance of what I was.
I pant for new scenes of beauty—new emotions, these are so
full of joy. Tell me, Busne, my own, own Busne, does happiness
like this never kill? I grow faint with it as one does when
the orange trees are thick overhead, and burdened with blossoms.
My breath comes heavily as if laden with their fragrance.
I long to creep away into the shadows, yonder, and
cry myself to sleep.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why do you wish to weep, my bird? Tears are for the
unhappy.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>“Yet you see that I am weeping; my eyes are blinded;
the lights down yonder seem floating in a mist. I cannot see,
and yet I know that you are smiling there in the moonlight.
It is happiness, oh, such happiness that floods my eyes.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He was not smiling, or if he had been for one moment,
the impulse died of itself the next. Educated as he had been,
hemmed in by conventionalities, it was impossible not to be
startled by the wildness, the depth of feeling revealed by this
strange child. The very reckless innocence with which she
exposed every sensation as it arose in her heart—the intensity
of feeling thus betrayed made him thoughtful, nay, anxious.
It was only for a brief time, however. Before Aurora could
notice his abstraction it had disappeared.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Is it, indeed, love for me, Aurora, that makes you so
happy?” he questioned with fond egotism.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I do not know; to-night I scarcely know myself. Love!
it has a soft, sweet sound—but does not mean enough. Oh, if
you could speak Rommany now, in our language are such
words; oh, how insipid your word love is when compared to
them.”</p>

<p class='c014'>In a deep, passionate voice, the very tones of which seemed
to thrill and burn into the heart, she uttered some words in
pure Rommany, that language which has yet been traced to
no given origin. Like ourselves, it is an outcast, vagabond
dialect, which baffles investigation.</p>

<p class='c014'>He understood nothing of what she said. But her eyes so
dazzlingly brilliant; her lips kindled to a vivid red, as it were,
by the burning words that passed through them; the exquisite
modulations of each tone, all had a powerful effect upon the
young man—powerful, but not that which might have been
expected, for it filled his mind with distrust.</p>

<p class='c014'>She did not heed the change in his countenance. Juliet
herself was never more thoroughly inspired or more trusting.
Crafty in all things else, our women are single-hearted as
children in their love. Truth itself is not more constant. Religion
does not give you a trust more perfect—religion—love
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>is a religion to them, they have no better, poor, wandering
creatures, bereft of all things, home, name, nationality, faith.
But all people must have something that they deem holy, something
upon which the soul can lean for strength and comfort.
Happier nations put faith in a God, we poor outcasts have
only our household affections, and we keep them sacred as
your altars.</p>

<p class='c014'>Though the gipsy adopts the faith of any nation that gives
him protection, becomes Catholic, Protestant, Mohammedan,
Idolater, as the case may be, it is all a pretence. In his soul
he loathes the object that he craftily seems to worship.</p>

<p class='c014'>But the Englishman knew nothing of this. He had no idea
of the rigid bonds with which antique custom hedges in the
domestic affections in a gipsy household. These affections
are the most sacred thing known to us. I have said that as
a people we have no other religion.</p>

<p class='c014'>With all this ignorance of our customs, how could he comprehend
a creature like that, with her unreserve, her passion
so vivid, that it struggled constantly for some new medium
of expression, and grew impatient of the stately Spanish, and
the few English words that seemed to chill every impulse
as she strove to frame it into utterance. He could not believe
that a woman trained to deception, wild, unchecked, nay,
taught to believe the right wrong, was in everything that
related to her own womanly tenderness true as gold—honest
as infancy.</p>

<p class='c014'>He shrunk from this poor child then, as her own language
gushed up and swept the cold Spanish from her lips. It
seemed to him that she must have uttered those words before;
perhaps to some traveller-dupe like himself; perhaps to Chaleco—Chaleco.
He began to dwell upon that name with jealous
eagerness, and coupled it with the words of Rommany that
still trembled on Aurora’s lips. For the first time he began
to doubt the poor gipsy girl; yet I, who know the women
of his own people to the soul, say to you most solemnly, that
among the best of his fair compatriots he might have searched
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>a life-time, and in vain, for a young heart so pure in every
loving impulse, so thoroughly virtuous as that which beat within
the velvet bodice of the little Gitana.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Aurora, look in my face,” he said, seizing both her hands
as she ceased speaking.</p>

<p class='c014'>She did look in his face with a glance that ought to have
shamed him—a glance, smiling, fond, and yet so void of evil.
He might have searched in those eyes till doomsday, and
found nothing there but a beautiful reflection of himself.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Aurora, you have repeated these heathenish words before!”</p>

<p class='c014'>He made the assertion somewhat faintly, for something in
her look half-smothered the suspicion as it arose to his lips.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Before! when?” she answered, in smiling surprise.</p>

<p class='c014'>“To Chaleco, perhaps.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“To Chaleco—oh, never; I could not speak thus to Chaleco,”
and the poor girl shuddered at the sound of that name, as an
apostate would when reminded of his old faith.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But—your chief, this Chaleco, he has uttered them to
you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“He—where—at what time?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Here, perhaps, by moonlight, as you are now standing by
me.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She looked at him with a troubled and questioning eye.
He was a mystery to her then, and the child was striving to
fathom the new feeling that she saw in his countenance.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No! Chaleco never came here with me at night—never
at all since we were little children! Have I not told you that
he is my betrothed?”</p>

<p class='c014'>She spoke sadly, almost in tears.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, is not that a good reason why he of all others should
overwhelm you with this sweet Rommany, here by moonlight, as
you now stand with me?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, that could never happen,” she exclaimed eagerly,
“they would take the countship from him—they would drive
us both ignominiously from the tribe; you do not know our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>ways, our laws. Of all the men in our tribe, Chaleco would not
dare to seek me here.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is not permitted; we are betrothed, and so never must be
alone; it would be infamy!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And to be here with me, is that nothing?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“There is no law that keeps us from seeking the Busne. It
is our duty. From them we win most gold!”</p>

<p class='c014'>The young man recoiled.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Gold, is it for that you come?” he said bitterly. “No, no,
I have offered tenfold what she has ever taken. It was not for
that you came, Aurora, I had rather die than think it. Speak,
child, tell me it was not for gold that you sought me!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I dared not go home empty-handed, for the grandame
would have given me blows,” answered the poor girl, while tears
began to run down her cheeks. “I could not dance to others
as in former times; yet I never touched a piece of your coin
without feeling all the strength leave me—without longing to
hide myself from every one. Of late you have never offered
money when I came.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I know—I know,” said the young man, quickly, “it seemed
like a desecration; I could not do it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, how happy I was to feel this, it made me so grateful,
but I was afraid of her. Sometimes I would be for hours getting
home, in hopes that she would be asleep?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“My poor child, I never thought of this. Is the old Sibyl
cruel to you, then?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Every one is cruel to me now—every one but you; and to-night,
it seems sometimes, as if you were joining them. What
have I done that you should make me weep like the rest?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Nothing, my poor Aurora, nothing. The fault is mine; I
was annoyed by what you told me of this Chaleco; it made me
unreasonable.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Was that all?” cried the poor little gipsy, brightening up,
and pressing her lips softly down into the palm of his offered
hand.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>He made no answer, but drew her gently toward him, and
for a time they stood together in thoughtful silence. Their
eyes were bent on the same object, one that they had usually
avoided; for there was little promise of tranquillity in that
direction.</p>

<p class='c014'>Amid the luxuriance of the scene before them, so full of all
that might reasonably win the attention, their eyes were fascinated
by one object alone, and that so dreary, so uninviting, that
it aroused nothing but ideas of sin and wretchedness, unhappy
subjects for hearts laden as theirs were with the first sweet impulses
of affection.</p>

<p class='c014'>They were looking towards the Barranco, that bleak ravine,
cut like a huge wound in the beautiful hills, on whose barren
sides the gipsy dwellings were burrowed. Even with the soft
moonlight sleeping over its sterility, the ravine had a miserable
aspect, choked up with great, spectre-like aloes and coarse
prickly pears—with a few dusty fig trees, and stunted vines
trailing themselves along the meagre soil that just served to
cover them with a sparse growth of leaves.</p>

<p class='c014'>These unseemly objects were now blended into one mass of
blackness in the depth of the ravine, giving lurid force to
some dozen forges in full blast, that shot their weird fires from
the open caves above.</p>

<p class='c014'>This was no unusual thing. The gipsies all over the world
have been workers of iron from the beginning, and those of
Granada were ever most busy at their craft after sunset. But
this evening the fires seemed to glow with unusual brilliancy.
Long lines of light shot across the ravine. Men and women
moved to and fro before the open caves. It was a scene that
Dante would have loved.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is strange,” said the Englishman, musingly, “it is strange
that any human being could select that miserable place to live
in. There is something unearthly—fiendish in the choice.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Choice,” answered Aurora, sadly, “whoever allows choice
to the Zincali? No, no, if there is one spot on earth more
dreary than another, it is set aside for them.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>“And you, Aurora, so delicate, so full of imagination, how
can you live there, burrowed up in the earth like some beautiful
wild animal? Surely, surely any fate must be better than
that!”</p>

<p class='c014'>The young man looked at her earnestly. His words had not
been addressed to her, but were an argument against his own
conscience—a reply to some undercurrent of thought all the
time going on in his mind. He was about to say something
more, to utter the thought that was taking form in his own
bosom, but she looked at him so earnestly—her large, fond eyes
so full of innocent love-light sought his with so sweet a trust—he
could not go on. The holy influence of true affections clung
to his soul like fetters of gold. The evil spirit tempting him so
powerfully was not strong enough to fling them off.</p>

<p class='c014'>Her ignorance, her helplessness, what a defence it proved
against all his knowledge—for young as he appeared, the
stranger was an old man in experience! He had begun to live
early. Youth had been swept from his path as if by a tornado.
The wrong that he might do then could have none of the excuses
which inexperience gives. He was no ordinary person,
but had lived more in those brief years than many an old man.</p>

<p class='c014'>She saw no second meaning in his words, but turning her eyes
once more upon the Barranco, answered according to her own
innocent interpretation of their import.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It does seem dark to me now. I never felt it till lately,
but the caves are very dismal, close, smoky; the air seems to
smother me at night. Besides, I am afraid it is only in the old
woods yonder, or up here, lifted half way into the sky, that I
can breathe freely. You are looking at the ravine,” she added,
“and I—now I can feel how coarse, how dark, how like a den
for wild animals it seems to you—for within the last few weeks
I have felt a strange love of beautiful things—for with them I
can think of you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then you never think of me in connection with that infernal
hollow yonder?” questioned the young man.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What, yonder? Oh, no, within the darkness that was once
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>my home, surrounded by those strong, fierce men, grimed
with iron dust, and smelling of the mules they have been tending—I
fold you deep in my heart, afraid to turn my thoughts
that way—I bury you in my sleep, and strive not to exist till I
can escape hither. It seems like two worlds, this, where you
sometimes come, and yonder where I cannot even think of
you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But here you are happy even though I am not present.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Ah, yes, here I am free—here I have such dreams—oh, a
thousand times brighter than any that ever come to my sleep.
Sometimes I think these soft, sweet dreams are better than
being with you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And in these dreams are we ever separated?” questioned
the youth, pursuing the same undercurrent of thought that had
swept through his bosom all that evening. But she did not
take his meaning; the time for reflection had not arrived; she
was too busy with her own sensations for anything but dreams.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Separated! oh, no. What would the brightest of these
dreams be worth if you were not in the midst? I love to come
up here just before nightfall, when the snowy top of Sierra
Nevada seems sprinkled with roses, and a soft floating haze,
now purple, now golden, settles upon the plain, the hills, and
the beautiful old city—when the insects are nestling themselves
down to sleep, and the nightingales send gushes of music
through the woods. How I love to sit here, perfectly alone,
while the colors float together in soft masses on the walls
around, and all this vast heap of ruin shapes itself into beauty
again.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then all that is ruinous, all that is gloomy disappears; the
marble pillars glitter with gold again, a network of snow breaks
over these paintings. From that marble slab in the corner, perforated
in a hundred places, floats up a cloud of perfume. I feel
it in my garments, and penetrating the folds of my hair. I go
forth. <em>We</em> go forth, for you are always by my side. The long
colonnade yonder glitters in the twilight; the filagree arches are
tipped with a rosy hue. The shadows are all of a faint purple;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>the pavements gleam beneath our feet like beds of precious
stones. The nightingales are heard more faintly as we penetrate
deep into the building, overpowered by the silvery rush of
fountains at play in the courts.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The myrtle hedges rustle softly as we pass into the Court
of Lions. There in my dreams I replace all that has been torn
away; the hundred slender columns that support those filagree
arches are once more burnished with gold. The old tints break
out afresh from the capitals, wreathing their endless variety
with radiant colors. The azulejo pillars glowing like twisted
rainbows, all come back softened by a mental haze that creeps
over me at such times.</p>

<p class='c014'>“We leave the court—pass on through those wonderful
arches, and enter the saloons which people say were once the
most private retreat of the Moorish kings. But they are
never in my mind—those dead monarchs. It is for another—only
one—that I heap those alcoves in which sultanas have
slept with silken cushions, and mingle cool drinks from the
snows of Alpujarras; those decorations upon the wall, so like
the rare antique lace with which queens adorn themselves—that
saloon, with its great pillars of marble gleaming in the light
like solid masses of pearl, and crowned with ornaments so rich,
that when broken to pieces each fragment is a marvel of itself.
Even these are not beautiful enough for one whom my soul
makes lord of all!</p>

<p class='c014'>“For him I bring back the past. Rare colors start up,
fresh and vivid, from under that exquisite lace-work, where you
can just see that they have existed. Stalactites starred with
gold penetrate downward like a rich conglomeration of pearls
escaping through a thousand rainbows embedded in the ceiling.
It is a luxury to breathe the air in these rooms, so rich with
perfumes, yet kept so pure and cool by the innumerable fountains
that penetrate every corner with their dreamy murmurs.”</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER V.<br> <span class='large'>FAIRY SCENES AND FATAL PASSIONS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>My mother paused. She had talked herself out of breath;
but her eyes, her mouth, the very position of her person were
eloquent still. She had spoken rapidly and in broken sentences.
Her language was graphic, and more like an inspiration than I
can give it in cold English. Her very ignorance gave picturesque
effect to her fancies. I have done her injustice, because
my set phrases have tamed her vigorous wildness with conventionalisms.
The pictures that she placed before the wondering
Englishman in her own wild fashion were vivid as stars.</p>

<p class='c014'>She was silent awhile, and he could see the bright inspiration
fading from her features. Her eyes drooped; the reserve,
half shame, half exhaustion which follows the inspired moments
of genius, crept over her. She dared not turn her eyes upon
the young man, he was so still, and she thought that he must
be smiling derisively—strange sensitiveness for one of her
class—but genius is of no class. And though my mother was
wild and untamed, leaving neither poem, painting, or statue
behind, her entire life was a poem unwritten save in her gentleness
and her agony.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Ah, if these dreams did not fade so soon,” she said, at last,
in a timid voice, apologizing for her late abandonment, “but
they last scarcely longer than the sunset which brings them.
Do these sweet thoughts ever haunt you?” she continued, still
with downcast eyes.</p>

<p class='c014'>“They have!—yes, they have!” replied the young man, in
a voice so stirred with feeling that the gipsy started, and the
blood left her cheeks.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And did they die thus?” she questioned.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>“Briefer, shorter—my dreams—but why talk of them? We
are in Spain, alone—here in the Alhambra—the Alhambra!
the very realm of fancies! Why talk of dreams that I may
have had in other times, other lands? Indulge in yours, poor
child, this is the place, the time. Oh, if you could only dream
on forever; I have lost the power!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Dream on forever!” cried the gipsy girl, lifting her eyes
and her voice. “What, here, and with that in view?—my
dreams here! my life there. Here all is life, grace, beauty,
love! There, burrowed in the earth, stifled, struggling, the
miserable Gitanilla—there is no waking from that!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Her lithe form was drawn to its height. She pointed with
one hand toward the gloomy Barranco, and with the other
dashed away the tears that sprang, like great diamonds, to her
eyes; then flinging both hands into the air, she sunk upon the
floor, buried her face in the crimson folds of her saya, and
broke into a passion of sobs.</p>

<p class='c014'>The young man looked down upon her, almost calmly, quite
in silence. Those who have suffered much naturally shrink
from any exhibition of strong passions; besides, it was the first
evidence of the fierce spirit of her race that he had witnessed.
This new phase in her character astonished and repulsed him.
It was the first time that she had seemed to him absolutely a
Gitana. So, as she wept out her bitter passion, he stood over
her, if not irritated, at least painfully thoughtful.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Aurora,” he said at last, stooping toward her with gentle
coldness, “get up; cease weeping thus. It annoys me; I do
not love you so well!”</p>

<p class='c014'>She started up, choked back the sobs that were swelling in
her throat, and stood before him with downcast eyes, like a
culprit.</p>

<p class='c014'>This self-power, the gentle submission that followed, reassured
her lover. He smiled cordially again, took her hand,
and drew her gently from the colonnade, moving downward
partially in darkness, till they reached the Court of Lions.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Gitanilla and her companion entered the Court of Lions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>through one of those incomparable pavilions that enrich each
end of that marvellous spot. No dream could be more heavenly
than the beauty that surrounded them. The gorgeousness,
that time and siege had swept away, was more than
replaced by the luminous grace shed over what remained by
the moonlight.</p>

<p class='c014'>On either hand stood a line of shaft-like columns, delicate
beyond all our ideas of usefulness, yet with a superb filagree
peristyle resting lightly, as so much snow upon their exquisite
capitals—these capitals, so full of varied art, each fragment of
marble a marvel of itself—each faded leaf the richest fancy of
an artist. The arches rising between these graceful pillars
were half choked up with shadows, leaving all the gorgeous
apartments to which they led in misty doubt. It seemed as if
with a single wave of the hand you might sweep away those
curtain-like shadows, with a step enter the saloons, and find the
moon sleeping upon their silken cushions.</p>

<p class='c014'>It chanced that the Englishman had never visited the Court
of Lions before, when the moon was at its full. He stood within
the portico spell-bound, those noble masses of filagree work,
rising up from the supporting pillars, seemed a marvel of fairy
work, like ocean foam frozen into shapes of beauty—the pavement
glittering with azulejos, broad golden tints, rich blue and
red prevailing—the noble Fountain of Lions, rushing in floods of
crystal over its great alabaster basin, which gleamed through
the falling torrent like a solid mass of ice raining itself away,
but never diminishing, all filled him with wonder and delight.
How those shining water-drops idealized the twelve marble
lions, upon whose backs the alabaster basin rested, flooding
them with sheets of crystal, wreathing their huge legs with
pearly froth, sending a shower of bubbles into their scaly manes,
eddying, leaping, whirling around them, a fantastic storm of
light, through which no deformity could be discovered!</p>

<p class='c014'>Nothing but the rush of these falling waters could be heard
in the Alhambra. Everything else was still as death. Oh, it
was happiness to breathe in this wilderness of beauty! After
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>all, there is such a thing as being intoxicated with mere physical
harmony. With me great joy always rains itself away in
tears. To my fancy, no person ever experienced perfect
happiness, who has not felt the blissful dew leave his heart in
tears.</p>

<p class='c014'>But to know this, the bitter feelings of our nature must not
have been recently disturbed. Neither the Gitanilla nor her
lover were sufficiently tranquil for a thorough appreciation of
the scene. Their thoughts were too much occupied with each
other. Still, it was impossible to look upon this wonderful
spot and not yield themselves up to it for a time, and this
had a softening influence upon him. She, poor thing, required
nothing to subdue her, for there is not a being on earth so
gentle as a high-spirited woman when her strong passion is once
surrendered—I will not say subdued—to the influence of the
man she loves.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER VI.<br> <span class='large'>THE SIBYL AND THE LOVERS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>There had been no absolute disagreement between Aurora
and her lover; yet with that keen intuition which belongs to
love, and which becomes almost superhuman when love blends
with genius in a woman’s heart, she felt that he was disturbed,
that she had done something to arouse painful thoughts, which
led him, for the time, away from her. She did not weep—he
had told her that grief annoyed him—but in the shadow of that
beautiful portico her little heart might heave, unnoticed, beneath
its velvet bodice, and, spite of herself, tears would swell
up into her great, mournful eyes.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You seem weary, little one,” he said at length, taking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>heed of her drooping attitude. “Let us find a place to sit
down. I also begin to feel tired; we have been wandering in
the ruins these three hours!”</p>

<p class='c014'>He moved on, and she kept by his side, with her face averted,
that he might not see her tears. They crossed an angle of the
court, and entering one of the arches, passed through an open
door into the <i><span lang="es">Sala de los Abencerrages</span></i>. The marble basin of a
fountain, now dry, occupied the centre of this room, and upon
its rounded edge the two seated themselves.</p>

<p class='c014'>Here the moonbeams came more faintly, penetrating the open
work cloister, and throwing fantastic shadows on the pavement.
Beautiful stalactites hung over them, peering downward,
as it were, from a bed of shadows. Portions of the
walls were dim. The rest gleamed out, with all their delicate
tracery revealed, like luminous frost-work, such as you, of a
colder climate, find upon your window-panes, when the mornings
are unusually cold.</p>

<p class='c014'>They had been sitting there some minutes, yet I do not think
they had spoken. His arm was around her, and it is impossible
that he should not have felt the swelling of her heart, for,
as I have said, it was flooded with a tender grief, brought on
by that hard, hard thing to bear, the first reproof from beloved
lips. He was a man of strong feelings, but not one to utter
those feelings much in words. A degree of proud reserve followed
him even in his moments of deepest tenderness.</p>

<p class='c014'>No man ever guessed half that was going on in his heart,
and what is stranger still, no woman ever knew the whole.
There might have been something of pride in his sensations
when he saw the entire control that he had gained over that
poor, wild heart. For what human being is above pride in that
conquest which sweeps the entire life of another into his bosom?
But he was touched also with a feeling of sadness, of regret for
having moodily reproved her for what was, after all, the spirit
of her race. Still he did not speak these regrets, but drew her
closer to him, and taking her little brown hand in his, pressed
it to his lips.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>He felt her heart leap against his arm, but she only crept
a little closer to him, trembling all over, and smiling through
her tears.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And do you indeed love me so much?” he said, with a tone
of sadness in his voice, for he was asking himself where must
all this end; and the answer that presented itself made his better
nature recoil.</p>

<p class='c014'>She drew his hand toward her, and pressed her lips upon
the palm. There was something peculiar and child-like in this
act. With all her unreserve, it was the only outward proof
that she had ever given him of the passion that was transfiguring
her whole nature.</p>

<p class='c014'>While her lips were still upon his palm, he felt her start, listen,
and shudder all over. Then clinging to his arm with one
hand, she turned her head and looked backward over her shoulder.
It was in this chamber that the Abencerrages were supposed
to have been beheaded, and a deep, broad stain, which
tradition marks out as their blood, discolors half the marble
fountain on which the lovers sat. Feeling her shudder, and
remarking that her head was turned that way, he supposed that
it must be this blood shadow which suddenly occupied her
thoughts.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Nay, how childish,” he was beginning to say; but she broke
from his arm, rushed by the fountain, and seizing hold of a slender
pillar at the opening of an alcove, all in shadow, as if
stricken by some sudden fear, stood peering into the recess.</p>

<p class='c014'>He arose and was going toward her, when a little object,
scarcely larger than a child of ten years old, and so thin that it
seemed but the shadow of something else, passed slowly by him.
He would not have believed it human, but for the snake-like
glitter of two eyes that gleamed their rage upon him, and gave
vitality to the shadow as it passed.</p>

<p class='c014'>Aurora still clung to the column, waving to and fro as if she
must have fallen but for that support. She turned her face to
his as he came up, but the pallor that lay upon it, the fear that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>quivered over limb and feature, had utterly changed her. He
would not have known the face again.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Aurora, what is this? What terrible thing has happened?”
he exclaimed, reaching forth his arm to support her. But she
shrank away, shuddering, and still clinging to the pillar, she
writhed herself behind it, whispering hoarsely,</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is my grandmother; she has heard us!”</p>

<p class='c014'>The Englishman was enough affected by this to hasten into
the court, and satisfy himself that the person who had passed
him was indeed Aurora’s grandmother. He saw her gliding
away through the shadowy side of the cloisters, and it seemed
to him that muttered wrath and shrill curses were blended with
the silvery rush of the fountain.</p>

<p class='c014'>The sound struck him with strange terror. Still ignorant of
the exact danger that might threaten him or the poor Gitanilla,
he could not account for the cold thrill that passed through his
frame as the curses pierced to his ear through the sweet fall of
those waters.</p>

<p class='c014'>He went back into the <em>Sala de los Abencerrages</em>, and found
my mother crouching down by the marble basin, with her wild
eyes turned toward the entrance.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Was it she? Did she speak?” whispered the poor child,
rising with difficulty and moving toward him.</p>

<p class='c014'>The young man was shocked by this wild terror, so disproportioned,
as he thought, to the cause. He took both her hands
in his and shook them gently, hoping thus to arouse her from
the trance of fear that seemed to have benumbed the very life
in her veins.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Sit down by me, Aurora—sit down, child, here in your old
place, and tell me what all this means.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He spoke with gentle authority, and without a shadow of the
terror that shook every limb of her body. The sound of his
clear, bold voice seemed to reassure her. She crept forward
with timid hesitation, and allowed him to place her by his
side.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Now tell me, child, what troubles you thus? If that vicious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>shadow was indeed your grandmother, she has gone away
quietly enough, no harm has come of it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You little know,” said the Gitanilla, still keeping her eyes
upon the entrance—“you little know our people, or her.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But what is there for me to learn? Tell me what this fear
means?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It means,” answered the poor thing, locking her hands hard
and pressing them down upon her trembling knees—“it means
that they will poison me.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Poison you! this is the madness of fear,” exclaimed the
young man, impatiently.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Or perhaps stone me to death in some dark hollow of the
mountains, the whole tribe hunting down one poor creature for
her love of the Busne, Chaleco among the first.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Aurora, are you mad? Has this miserable little witch
crazed you?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You will not believe me—you have not seen the poison drao
scattered into the wholesome food which an enemy is to eat—or
a poor girl strangled in her bed, and buried in some rude pass
of the mountains, on the very day when she was to have danced
at her own wedding festival.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But this is murder!” cried the young man. “The laws
of Spain will not permit men to kill their females in cold
blood.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Our laws are older than those of Spain,” answered the
Gitanilla, with a certain degree of pride in her tone, as if she
gloried in the antiquity of the very custom that was to crush
her. “Our laws are older and better kept than those of the
Busne; traditions do not run so far back as their origin. They
are fixed and unchangeable—he who breaks them dies!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But what have you done, innocent child, that these laws,
however strengthened by antiquity, should fall on you?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I love you, a Busne—one of the race we hold accursed—our
enemies—our oppressors. I am alone with you, and have
been for hours, here in these vast ruins. But that is nothing;
that they approve so long as it brings gold; but I love you!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>I have said it in words, in my looks, every way in which love
can speak when it burdens the heart with its sweet joy. She,
my weird grandame, has seen this. Did I not feel that she
was close by in the ambassador’s hall?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But they dare not kill you for that—for the innocent
affection which you could not help—affection that has dreamed
of no wrong.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“She has seen us here, sitting together; she has heard me,
heard you. They will believe me an outcast of the tribe, and
kill me as they would a viper!”</p>

<p class='c014'>The young man arose, walked out into the court, and began
to pace up and down the glittering pavement, hurriedly, as
one seeks rapid motion when some great mental or moral
struggle is going on in the mind. Gradually his steps became
more rapid; his brow flushed, and with an impetuous movement
of one hand, as if thus dashing aside all further consideration
of a harassing subject, he sought the Gitanilla again.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Aurora,” he said, in a hurried manner, “you shall never
go back into that nest of fiends—look up, child—you are mine
now. They shall not touch a hair of your head, or even look
upon your face again! Come, what have you to fear? I am
powerful—I am rich, and I love you. I struggle against it
no longer—it is a duty now, I love you! Go with me to my
own country—I cannot give you this sky or these fairy ruins,
but you shall be surrounded with beautiful things nevertheless.
You shall study, learn; forget that miserable ravine burrowed
with human fox-holes, and swarming with murderers. Come,
Aurora, look up, I long to see that cold, dead color swept
away. Smile, smile my bird, we will not part again.”</p>

<p class='c014'>When a nation has but one virtue, how powerful that one
must be. There is much good in every human heart that God
has created, and when all that good pours itself into a single
channel, it has a power and vitality which men of more diffuse
cultivation little dream of.</p>

<p class='c014'>Aurora knew nothing of her lover’s rank, of his wealth, or
the thousand barriers that lay between his condition and hers.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>She was aware that sometimes, when a Gitano becomes wealthy—a
rare case—he had been known to wed a Busne wife, but
that such unions invariably made the Gitano an object of
suspicion and dislike to his own people. If this privilege
were permitted to the men, it might be—she could not tell,
no case had ever come beneath her observation—extended
to the females also. But then a betrothed female like herself—the
promised wife of a count—how was this to be hoped?
All these thoughts, full of doubt and trouble, came upon
my poor mother while the Englishman stood impatiently—for
his restrained manner had entirely disappeared—waiting her
reply.</p>

<p class='c014'>“They would not let me go—I am betrothed. No one of
our females have ever married with the Busne,” she said, at
last, in a voice that betrayed the utter despondency that possessed
her.</p>

<p class='c014'>The young man started, and a flush swept over his forehead.
At first he found it difficult to speak. How very, very hard
it is for a man, whose impulses are all honorable, to express
a wrong wish in words! But after a brief struggle he became
cold and grave. She must understand his full meaning. He
would not deceive—would not even persuade her. If she went
with him it must be with a full knowledge of her position, of
the impossibility that any marriage could ever exist between
them.</p>

<p class='c014'>Some men would have glossed this over, covered it with
transcendental poetry, smothered the sin with rose-leaves. He
did nothing of the kind. Knowing the wrong, he would neither
conceal this conviction from himself nor her. Therefore it was
that, with a cold, almost severe conciseness, he explained himself.
True, there was little merit in this; it was rather a
peace offering to his own pride than a homage to truth. From
all that he had heard of the gipsies, he did not believe that
anything he was saying could make much difference to the
Gitanilla. But it was due to himself, and so he spoke plainly.</p>

<p class='c014'>She understood him at last. It was with great difficulty,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>for the idea entered her mind as a proposition of murder would
have done. It dawned upon her by degrees, arousing and
kindling the wild Gitana blood in her veins with every new
thought. She heard him through, not without attempting
to speak, but the effort seemed strangling her. He saw that
she writhed faintly, once or twice, but heeded it not and
went on.</p>

<p class='c014'>At length she sprang up, her cheeks in a dusky blaze, her
eyes full of lightning. Her little tawny hand was clenched
like a vice and stamping her foot upon the pavement, she
struggled for voice. It broke out at last, loud and ringing,
like the cry of an angry bird.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am a Gitana—a Gitana. Did you take me for a Busne?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Before he could answer, or had half recovered from the
surprise into which this storm of passion threw him, she had
gone. He saw her dart into the cloister, and caught one
glimpse of a shadow that seemed to leap across the court, but
even that had disappeared before he could reach the broad
moonlight.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER VII.<br> <span class='large'>WAITING FOR VENGEANCE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Clare stood in the Court of Lions, absolutely bewildered by
the suddenness of what had happened. As he listened the
sound of a footstep, heavier than the one he sought—but of
this he did not think at the time—reached him from the lower
end of the court. He moved hurriedly in that direction, and
just as he reached the azulejo pillars, that still retain their first
beauty in that portion of the ruin, a man came toward him,
but keeping behind the columns with a sort of cowardly ferocity,
like one who was seeking an opportunity to strike in the
dark.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>The Englishman paused. There was something in the appearance
of this man, closely as he kept to the shadows, which
reminded him of an unpleasant adventure that he had met on
his route to Granada. The idea was enough. He darted forward
and stood face to face with the leader of a prowling band
of gipsies who had robbed him, not two months before, on his
way from Seville.</p>

<p class='c014'>The man seemed to recognize him also. At first he slunk
away as if with a hope of concealment, but a slight jingle of the
numerous silver tags on his jacket, and a stealthy movement of
the right arm downward, while his eyes followed the Englishman
like a basilisk, were significant of some more vicious
intent.</p>

<p class='c014'>Slowly, and as a weary man might change his position, the
gipsy drew up his figure, and a gleam of moonlight shooting
through the network of an arch close by, fell upon the blade
of a Manchegan knife which he held with a backward thrust of
the arm, slowly raising the point to a level with the heart he
wished to reach.</p>

<p class='c014'>Few strangers are mad enough to go unarmed in Spain.
The Englishman was bold as a lion too, but with all this he
could not have drawn the pistol from his bosom before that
knife had done its work. Still he made the effort, keeping his
eyes steadily on the man, and with something of the effect which
such looks have upon fierce animals. But the point of that
murderous blade rose higher and higher. In another moment
it would have been sped; but on the instant a sharp clutch
was laid on the assassin’s arm, and the gipsy Sibyl thrust herself
between the combatants.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Back, Chaleco—begone, I say. How dare you step in
between me and my right? Think you Papita wants your
knife to help her?” cried the fierce old witch, grinding her
sharp teeth together at each pause of her speech.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But the wrong is mine,” answered Chaleco fiercely. “Aurora
was my betrothed: let her die—let her die; but he, I
will send him before!”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>He struggled with the old woman who had clutched the
knife with her tawny fingers and clung to him, hissing out her
wrath in his face like a wild cat.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Die! who says Aurora shall die? Is she not mine, the
grand-daughter of a count? Who shall condemn her but myself?
When I have said she is guilty, then you may talk of
wrong—not before. Go home. How dare you follow my
grand-daughter when she goes about her work!”</p>

<p class='c014'>But the gipsy shook her off, wrenching the knife from her
clutch with a violence that flung her to the ground.</p>

<p class='c014'>She started fiercely up. The red turban had fallen from her
grey hairs, and they streamed around her like a torn banner
that has once been white. Her eyes gleamed and flashed with
lurid fire. She flung up her long, flail-like arms, and shrieked
forth curses that seemed absolutely to blast the air around like
a simoon. She spoke in Rommany, but the curses that came
seething from her heart were more horrible to the Englishman,
than if he had understood the words. They cowed even the
gipsy chief. He gave up his knife abjectly, and casting a fierce,
sullen look on the Englishman, slunk away.</p>

<p class='c014'>This sullen submission appeased the Sibyl’s fury. She followed
him into the darkest portion of the cloister, and seemed
to drop suddenly down from threats to expostulations, which
ended at last in low, wheedling tones, which gradually died
away in the melody of the fountain.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Englishman looked around like one in a dream. Not
fifteen minutes had elapsed since he sat in the <em>Sala de los Abencerrages</em>,
with the Gitanilla so close to him that he could hear
every full throb of her heart. Had she gone forever? That
storm of fiendish passion which he had just witnessed, was it
real? How still, how deliciously tranquil was the Alhambra!
Had that soft moonlight looked but a moment since on the
assassin’s knife close to his own heart? It seemed an impossibility.
He could not realize the terrible danger which even
yet threatened him.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was long before he could, by all the efforts of his strong
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>will, bring his thoughts under any degree of control. But he
did not leave the place, for the first reasonable reflection
aroused the keenest anxiety for the Gitanilla. Her fears of
death were not all fancies then. He remembered the old
Sibyl’s words; she had only claimed the right of vengeance as
her own. The proof which he held in his own person, was
enough to convince him that no laws could prevent crime in a
people to whom most crimes are held as virtues. Had he not
been plundered of property, and saved from death almost by a
miracle, in spite of the Spanish laws?</p>

<p class='c014'>His anxiety regarding the poor gipsy girl became tormenting.
Where could he seek her? Not at the ravine; surely
she would not go there, knowing the fiendish inhabitants so
well, and fearing all that she feared. The storm of her passion
had been so violent it could not last. The poor child to save
her own life must come back again. He would wait.</p>

<p class='c014'>He did wait, hour after hour, till the moon went down, and
nothing but the bright, holy stars kept watch over the Alhambra.
He traversed the saloons, explored the cloisters, and
leaving all that was beautiful behind him, wandered off among
those dark red towers that harmonized better with the gloomy
fears that possessed him.</p>

<p class='c014'>Still he continued the search, clambering up those broken
walls, tramping his way over wild flowers and weeds alike—called
to a distance, sometimes, by the rustle of a bird, and
mocked every instant by shadows that proved unreal as his
hopes. But he would not believe that Aurora had left the
ruins. Besides, rest was impossible. Alone in the little fonda
he must have gone mad with anxiety.</p>

<p class='c014'>Twenty times that night did he pass hurriedly through the
Gate of Justice, hoping to find her returning from the woods.
He searched the whole uneven sweep of those walls, clambering
up the declivities, and finding relief in the physical exertion
which covered his forehead and saturated his hair with moisture.</p>

<p class='c014'>When the first rosy light of morning quivered on the snows
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>of Alpujarras, he returned to the little fonda so weary, so hopelessly
dejected that he could hardly stand. His fate day had
come round again.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER VIII.<br> <span class='large'>THE BROKEN IDOL.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Any person who had seen that old gipsy Sibyl tearing her
way up the steep ascent of the Barranca that night, must have
fancied some evil spirit had broken loose, and was searching for
prey among the gaunt aloes and ragged prickly pears. The
sharp hiss with which she rent her garments from the harrowing
thorns—the fiendish energy with which she broke away
from each fresh grasp, betrayed a state of tormenting wrath
which Dante alone could describe. There was a force in this
bitterness, a concentration of gall that imbued her withered
frame through and through with frightful power. Her aged
limbs quivered with new life—she walked upright, flung aside her
stick, and, grasping the thorny plants firmly with her hands,
drew herself up the hill. The sharp leaves cut her like a knife,
tore her hands and drew long purple lines down her lean arms;
but no blood followed. Her veins seemed withered up, or
barely moistened by the gall that fed them with bitter vitality.</p>

<p class='c014'>The ravine was choked up with darkness; the fires were all
out, and the caves closed. Not a sparkle of the Darro could
be seen through the black mist that lay below; and the soft
winds that scattered fragrance from a wilderness of blossoms on
the <i><span lang="es">Sierra del Sol</span></i>, whose palace was crowned by a few rays of
light from the dusky moon, only served to stir the stifling dust,
through which the fierce old Sibyl waded ankle deep.</p>

<p class='c014'>With all her toil, the old woman held fast to her crimson
skirt, which she gathered up in front and hugged to her bosom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>attempting thus to keep a firm grasp on a mass of freshly gathered
herbs, which protruded from its folds, scattering a fragrant
odor upon the dusty air, as she crushed them tighter and tighter
in her ascent up the hill.</p>

<p class='c014'>At length she reached the door of her own cave and entered.
The lamp which she had left burning in its niche was pouring
forth a volume of mingled flame and smoke, and a few embers
glowed still among the white ashes that lay in heaps under the
brasier. A rustle of garments, a faint, shuddering shriek came
from a dark angle of the cave as the door was flung open. The
old Sibyl did not seem to heed it; but turned her eyes that way
with a look of blank ferocity, and moved on without appearing
to regard my poor mother who sat cowering on the ground, her
limbs gathered up beneath the gorgeous masses of her dress, and
her great gleaming eyes following each movement of the crone
with a scared and shrinking gaze, like those of an animal which
feels itself bound for the slaughter.</p>

<p class='c014'>As if unconscious that any living thing occupied the miserable
dwelling with herself, the old woman shook the herbs from
her garments, crouched down by the brasier, and, bending her
crooked fingers like the claws of a bird, began to rake the scattered
embers in a heap from the ashes, blowing them fiercely
with her lips till her face was lighted up by the glow like that
of a fiend. Half stifled with the smoke, she began to strangle,
and her cough sounded through the cave like the bark of a dog.
Still she would not leave her work, but sat down on the floor,
straightened a fold of her dusty saya between her hands, and
commenced blowing up the embers, till her breath came back
again.</p>

<p class='c014'>As the liquid in the bronze vase began to simmer, she gathered
up the loose herbs, and after twisting them into fragments
with a ferocity that sent their juice trickling through her fingers,
she cast them into the vase. Sometimes, when the stems were
tough, she employed her sharp teeth, wrangling with the poisonous
fibres like a wild cat over its prey.</p>

<p class='c014'>This was a fearful proof of the insane wrath that possessed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>her, for she knew well the deadly nature of those herbs, yet
remained insensible of the danger, even after her thin lips were
swollen and turgid with the poison.</p>

<p class='c014'>My poor mother, who had cowered in her corner watching all
this, could endure the sight no longer; but rising slowly up,
crept to her little bed-room and softly closed the door. The
old woman eyed her with a sidelong glance as she crept by, but
preserved silence and occupied herself with her fire.</p>

<p class='c014'>Thus an hour passed. Huge drops of perspiration stood on
the forehead of my great grandame, for the cave was becoming
insufferably warm, and she still bent over her work, imbibing
the steam and heat with the endurance of a salamander. At
last she lifted the vase from its supporter, and placing a broken
bowl upon the floor, drained off perhaps half a pint of dark liquid.
This she held up to the lamp and examined closely. A gleam
of horrid satisfaction was visible on her face, and she muttered,
“They think of distilling the drao—who gave them the
secret? Let them boast—let them fancy that the old woman
is of no further use. They must come to her for their poison
yet. Who else of all the tribe knows the secret, or could distil
death into one sweet drop like this?”</p>

<p class='c014'>She bent over the bowl; her head drooped. For the first
time she appeared to think steadily, and mingle her thoughts
with something of human feeling.</p>

<p class='c014'>The fire went out. Heavy smoke, for which there was no
outlet, gathered in a cloud of palpable darkness over her head.
The poison stood cooling by her side, imbued by a thick, inky
blackness, taken, as it were, from her thought; yet, for the first
time that night, there was something of human feeling mingled
with the bitterness of her nature. It might have been the pale,
frightened face of my mother, as she glided by, that awoke a
gleam of womanly regret in her fierce bosom. It might have
been the memory of some foregone event which this poor child
had shared with her; or the sobs that began to issue from the
little bed-room, like the stifled moan of an infant, might have
softened the iron of her nature.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>It is impossible for me to say which of the thousand strings
in that sered heart thrilled to the touch of the guardian angel
that always, while there is life, finds some tone of music in a
woman’s soul. But one thing is certain, the lurid fire in those
wicked eyes grew dull, and was smothered as they watched the
poison drao curdle and cool beneath them.</p>

<p class='c014'>And there was my wretched mother, all this time shut up in
the little stifled hole that she called a bed-room. Up to this
time, a sort of wild excitement had kept her up. Indignation,
terror, a conflict of feelings, which in her return from the Alhambra
had given her the speed and strength of a reindeer, still
burned in her heart like fire. But the stillness of the cave—the
slow, silent preparations which that old woman was making
for her death—all had a power to chill even her burning excitement.
The heart in her bosom seemed turning to stone.
Her limbs began to shrink and quiver with physical dread. She
was but a woman, poor thing, nay, a child almost, and death
was terrible to her, for the Spanish Gipsy has no bright dream
of an after life. They who suffer so much in this world have
no hope in death, but that of black oblivion. Why should they
wish to prolong misery so griping? Would they not be proscribed,
crushed, trampled on through all eternity? Would
the Busne grant them a place in heaven, they who have hunted
our whole race up and down, till it has been glad to find shelter
like serpents in the very bosom of the earth?</p>

<p class='c014'>My mother was afraid to die. The torture that she then
endured seemed preferable to that black, stony, eternal sleep,
which the end of life was to her.</p>

<p class='c014'>In her bed-room was a mutilated fragment of black marble.
It was, or had been, the body of a beast joined to a human
head. Though worn with time, hacked and broken, the grave,
thoughtful beauty of that countenance, the solemn thought that
seemed frozen into the stone, imbuing every fragment, must
have won attention even from a person who looked upon it only
as an antique of wonderful beauty.</p>

<p class='c014'>This fragment of Egyptian art stood upon the base of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>Roman pedestal, which the old Sibyl had found years before
among the broken rubbish of the Alhambra. It was of a time
coeval with the Roman altar, which you may yet find embedded
in the Torre del Homenage, and had a value to the antiquarian
of which my great grandame was fully aware. Though she
would have sold anything for money, this had been an offering
to her idol; and she, almost alone among our people, still kept
a traditionary hold upon the faith of Egypt. How she became
possessed of this antique I never knew; but it was the only thing
on earth which she held sacred, and to that she rendered idolatrous
devotion.</p>

<p class='c014'>As my mother sat upon her pallet bed, feeling the unnatural
strength ebb from her frame, her eyes fell upon this marble
face, turned with its grand serenity of expression toward her.
All at once it seemed as if she had found a friend. She remembered
the old Sibyl’s faith in this block of stone, and gazed
upon it with strange interest. The tumult of her feelings was
hushed. The natural yearning, which exists in every female
heart, for something to adore, something strong and high, from
which she can claim protection, possessed her. She folded her
hands in her lap and leaned forward, gazing on the marble face
till her eyes were full of tears. Directly she began to sob like
a child, and this was the sound that reached the old woman as
she bent over her drao.</p>

<p class='c014'>But that hard old heart soon shook off its human emotions.
Brutus was not more stern in his sense of justice, nor did he
show less of relenting; the laws of her people must be carried
out. She would yield the power of life or death over her
grandchild to no inferior member of her tribe; she alone would
be judge and executioner. Perhaps there was something of
mercy in this; the death she gave with her drao was easy,
almost delightful; a sleepy, voluptuous languor seized upon the
victim, grew sweeter, deeper, and eternal.</p>

<p class='c014'>Such was the fate meditated for the poor girl who was sobbing
in the next room. The tribe would have stoned her to
death. That old Sibyl had a touch of compassion in her murderous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>designs, but she was not the less determined to kill. She
took up the drao and set it in the same niche with the swaling
lamp. Then she passed into the bed-room softly as a cat, closing
the door after her with, great caution, as if they two had
not been quite alone.</p>

<p class='c014'>The poor Gitanilla sat, upon her miserable pallet, looking
wistfully toward that antique relic of old Egypt; but she
cowered down with a faint cry, as the old woman crept between
her and the marble, lifting up one hand as if denouncing her
for looking upon a thing that she held in reverence. What
passed in that miserable little room I cannot say. My mother
never spoke of it; and in her manuscript there was nothing
when it came to this part of her story, but great inky scrawls
that no one on earth could read.</p>

<p class='c014'>When the old Sibyl came forth Aurora was upon the ground,
her forehead resting against the idol, and murmuring some
wild words through a passion of tears.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Repeat,” said the Sibyl, standing over her, and holding up
the heavy iron lamp that flared lividly over the mutilated features
of the marble and the wild face of the Gitanilla. “Say
it again, thus with your face where it is. If there is a lie on
your lips that stone will sear them as with a red hot iron.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, grandame, I have spoken truth, nothing but truth.
See!” and with a sort of insane awe she pressed her lips upon
the broken mouth of the idol two or three times.</p>

<p class='c014'>The old woman was silent. The lamp shook in her hand;
her eyes were fixed upon the idol and the poor creature that
clung to it, as if she really expected to see that healthy form
fall crisped and withered away from the stone.</p>

<p class='c014'>The girl turned, clasped her grandame around the knees,
and lifting up her eyes, in which was a gleam of wild confidence,
exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am unhurt—I am unhurt—grandame, will you believe
me now?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Still the old woman was silent.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Grandame, mother of my mother, you will not let me die!”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>Terror and doubt again took possession of the poor thing.
She clung closer to the old woman, her eyes dusky with fear;
her lips growing pale again.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Chaleco must have your life—he will not believe you; no,
nor will the women of our tribe!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But you believe me, grandame!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And if I do, what then?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You have great power, grandame; our people acknowledge
it; the stars make you their mistress. You will save me from
Chaleco—from our fierce women”——</p>

<p class='c014'>“How, little one, how? I am old, they would wrest you
from my arms. They treat me like an infant already.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Let us leave them and seek the mountains, you and I,
grandame. They will not follow us up into the snow peaks!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“To-night I have clambered up to the Alhambra. It is the
first time in ten years; to-morrow my bones will be as stiff as
rusted iron. How am I to drag myself up to the mountains?
How am I, a count’s wife, to leave his people?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am a count’s daughter, but they wish to kill me!”
answered the poor girl, sadly. “You will not let them—say,
grandame, that you will save me from the Valley of Stones!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“They are many and strong—I an old woman, feeble with
years!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“They will stone me—oh, they will stone me! and I am
innocent of all they think against me!” still pleaded the
Gitanilla.</p>

<p class='c014'>The old woman was evidently troubled. She shook her
head, and cast wistful glances on her broken idol, as if interrogating
the stone.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Let me go by myself, then,” cried the girl, eagerly. “I
am told that countries stretch far away beyond the mountains.
There they will not know that I am an outcast, and my dancing
will get bread enough to eat.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The old woman did not heed her; she was still interrogating
the Egyptian stone. Quick flashes of intelligence shot across
her face; some project was evidently taking form in her brain.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>“He will not believe me—Chaleco will be first among them
with his story. I have no power to brave the laws, but I can
baffle them. Leave old Papita alone for that.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Now she seemed all alive with eager cunning, turning from
the force of her bitter wrath into a crafty old crone, anxious to
save the life of her grandchild, it is true, but exulting as much
in the thoughts of baffling all the keen hate and power of her
tribe.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Get up, little one: come sit down here on the bed by my
side, and let us talk,” she said, passing her hand over the head
of my mother, and caressing her with a grim smile.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You believe me innocent—you will not let them murder
me.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, yes, my star, I <em>know</em> you are innocent—else, you see
the drao yonder—by this time it had been curdling in your
blood.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then you will save me! Who is so powerful? Oh,
grandame, your little girl will yet live. Who shall dare to
contradict the will of Papita?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“He, Chaleco! ha! ha! he almost braved me to-night: but
he shall be brought round”——</p>

<p class='c014'>The girl turned faint, and grew paler than she had been
before that night.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, not that!—oh, not that! Let me die, grandmother—let
me die. I would rather a thousand times than marry
Chaleco.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The Sibyl laughed till her teeth shone again.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Marry Chaleco now!—why, child, he would strangle me if I
but hinted it! Oh, our people are wise in this generation,
wiser than old Papita. We shall see—we shall see!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What shall I do, grandame? What can you think of to
save me? They will tear me to pieces.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What shall I do?—why, take my right as a count’s
widow—murder you myself—bury you myself!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Grandame!” exclaimed the child, with a cry of horror.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And when they think your body deep in the Darro,” continued
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>the old crone, without noticing the cry, “Papita will be
sitting here with gold in her lap, and her pretty little Aurora
shall be married to the Busne, and far beyond the mountains!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Another cry, in which the love of that young heart leaped
forth in an agony of joy, made the Sibyl pause; but it was
only for a moment.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then my little one shall think of the poor old gipsy in her
cave, and send more gold—more and more, till power shall
indeed return to Papita.”</p>

<p class='c014'>But my mother sat upon the pallet wringing her hands, and
utterly abandoned to her grief once more. That one gleam of
joy had turned upon her heart sharper than a sword. She
remembered why she had fled from the Alhambra that night.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What is this?” said the old woman, sharply. “Tears
again? Bah, I am tired of them—speak!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Grandame,” sobbed the wretched girl, gasping for breath,
for she felt that her last hold on life was going, “the Busne
cannot save me—he will not marry a gipsy girl.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“He shall!” snarled the old woman. “By that he shall!”
and she pointed toward her idol.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Grandame!” exclaimed the girl, astonished.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Get up,” replied the Sibyl—“smooth that hair—put on the
bodice of blue velvet, and the saya edged with gold, that was
to have been the wedding-dress with Chaleco. Quick, or the
daylight will be upon us.”</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER IX.<br> <span class='large'>WAITING AND FEARING—A WILDERNESS OF BEAUTY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Aurora obeyed her grandmother almost hopefully; for her
faith in the Sibyl was unbounded. In a little time she appeared
in the outer cave, arranged in the picturesque costume which
should have been her wedding-garments. The old woman had
been pouring a quantity of the poison drao into a vial, which
she thrust into her bosom as the girl came in.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why do you take that?” she faltered out, struck with new
dread.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is for him—the Busne, if he falters in doing what I
shall ask.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Be it so,” said my mother, sadly, pointing toward the bowl.
“There will be enough left—I will go with him”——</p>

<p class='c014'>“You must,” answered the Sibyl, sharply. “Now come.”</p>

<p class='c014'>They left the cave, closing the door after them.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Stay,” exclaimed the old woman, going back, “you will
want food and drink.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She was gone a little time, and returned with a bottle of
water and some bread. These she handed to Aurora and
walked on, moving down the ravine toward the Alhambra.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was wonderful how much strength excitement had given
to that old crone; she scarcely seemed to feel the great fatigue
of the night, but with a quick, scrambling walk led the way in
silence, only calling back now and then for Aurora to move
faster, or the day would be upon them.</p>

<p class='c014'>They entered the enclosure of the Alhambra by <i><span lang="es">La Torre del
Pico</span></i>, and kept within the shadows, for, though the moon was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>down, it leaves a transparent atmosphere behind it in Granada;
and once or twice the Sibyl fancied that she heard footsteps
amid the ruins.</p>

<p class='c014'>Near <i><span lang="es">La Torre del Pico</span></i> stood, at that time, the grand
mosque of the Alhambra, the most exquisite remnant of Moorish
art in the world. An entrance to this mosque was easy, for
sacred as it had been, all its rich beauty lay exposed to ruin
like the rest.</p>

<p class='c014'>Papita led the way, holding my mother by the hand. A dim
light fell amid the delicate pillars innumerable as the young
trees in a forest, but guided by far-off memories, the Sibyl
threaded them confidently as if she had been walking through
her own barranca. She paused before that portion of the
mosque formerly the seat occupied by the Moorish Kings in
their worship. Here, by the gleam of azulejos, richer and far
more brilliant than any to be found elsewhere in Spain, and
which even the darkness could not subdue, she found the <em>Mih-rab</em>
or recess in which the Alcoran had been kept.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was a deep vaulted recess set thick with azulejos, that
burned like gems on a bed of gold. The floor was a single slab
of agate; and a belt of precious stones had spanned the arch
like a petrified rainbow. It was broken and partly defaced
now, but the very fragments were a marvel of beauty.</p>

<p class='c014'>Another might have looked with reverence on a spot so
enriched, that it might be worthy to hold the treasure kept
most sacred by a fallen nation. But to the old gipsy woman
such feelings and such things were a scoff.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Hide yourself in there,” she said, thrusting Aurora toward
the niche. “You will be driven out by no Moors coming to
worship; sit still if any one enters the mosque, or if steps
turn this way, stand up close to one of the porphyry pillars
yonder, moving so that it will be placed between you and the
intruder whichever way he comes.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But where do you go? How long must I wait?” said
Aurora, placing her foot on the glittering pavement of the
<em>Mih-rab</em>.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>“I go to find him,” was the terse answer. “Wait till <em>he</em>
comes, or till <em>I</em> come. You have food: be patient, and on
your life, let none of the tribe find you!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Aurora shrunk back into the recesses at this command, and
stood there motionless as stone till daylight glittered upon
the azulejos around her, and she was shrined, as it were, in a
mass of living gems.</p>

<p class='c014'>At length the terror that had kept her so motionless gave
way. She changed her position; sat down, began counting
the exquisite fragments that jewelled the wall, tracing the
delicate lines of gold and silver that crept like glittering moss
around them, with the tip of her fingers. At last, emboldened
by the silence, she stepped down from the recess, and wandered
restlessly around the body of the mosque.</p>

<p class='c014'>Notwithstanding the great causes for anxiety that beset her,
and though she had been in that spot before, she wandered
through its gorgeous mazes with a strange and delicious swell
of the heart. Love, the great magician, had unsealed her
eyes to the beautiful. Never before had she distinguished
the grand and varied richness of those columns. The deep,
many-tinted greens engrained in the verd-antique, jasper of
that rare kind which seems clouded with blood, grew beautiful
in her eyes. She saw pillars of oriental alabaster rising among
the forest of columns, like snow mellowed to golden richness
by a meridian sun; and others with sweeping clouds of the
deepest ruby tint, stained into a ground of dusky yellow.
These mingled with columns of glittering black, or sheeted
from floor to arch with gold, contrasted gorgeously with the
snow-white shafts that rose on every hand; some with capitals,
dashed lightly with gold; others cut, as it were, from solid
pearl, and all made precious with the most perfect sculpture.</p>

<p class='c014'>Filled, as I have said, with a new-born sense of the Beautiful,
my mother wandered through all this Byzantine gorgeousness,
amazed that she had never seen it before. With no
knowledge of architecture, she <em>felt</em> without understanding the
beautiful proportions of the building, while her eyes were fixed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>upon its pillars supporting arches graceful as the bend of a
rainbow, and enriched with a beauty hitherto unknown even
to Moorish art.</p>

<p class='c014'>Her heart was numb for the time, and she wandered on like
one in a dream—now looking upon the pavement, then lifting
her eyes upward where traceries of snow, delicate as a spider’s
web, but yet of a pearly richness, linked with blossoms of
silver, ran through the arches, chaining the pillars together
with a gleaming network. The doors, the royal seat, everything
around was one blaze of rich mosaic—the pavement
of white marble, starred with gorgeous tiles, spread away
beneath her feet. Broken, soiled by neglect, in ruins, as all
this was, perhaps it seemed but the more enchanting for that!
for to a keen imagination these fragments of beauty were suggestive
of an ideal perfection, which no art ever reached.
But my mother could not long be won from the great causes
of anxiety that surrounded her. Her heart began to ache
again, and with a weary step she sought the <em>Mih-rab</em>, and seating
herself on the agate floor, sat pondering over her own
miserable thoughts till the sun went down.</p>

<p class='c014'>With strained eyes and a weary heart, she saw the rich light
fade away from the pillars till the arches were choked up with
blackness, and all the slender columns seemed like spectres
crowding toward her hiding-place. She grew feverish with
anxiety; her lips were parched; a faintness crept through
her frame. It was not hunger, but she was exhausted, and
remembering the food her grandame had left, felt for it in the
darkness.</p>

<p class='c014'>She drank of the water, and tasted a mouthful of bread;
but it was suspense, not want of food, that had taken away
her strength. She could not endure to look out from her
hiding-place, for now that crowd of pillars seemed like men
of her tribe, all greedy and athirst for her young life.</p>

<p class='c014'>Thus she remained; it might be hours or minutes; it seemed
an eternity to her, and then she heard footsteps and a voice.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER X.<br> <span class='large'>THE COURIER AND HIS WILD VISITOR.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>At a back door of the little Fonde, which stands within the
enclosures of the Alhambra, sat a little old man, or if not absolutely
old, so withered and shrunk up that it was impossible, at
a little distance, not to think him aged. But at a close view
you saw, by the sharp black eyes, the thin, but unwrinkled
lips, and a certain elasticity of movement, that he had scarcely
passed the middle age of life. A coat of drab cloth, with
short-clothes of the same material, a plush waistcoat, knee
and shoe-buckles of gold, and silk stockings, at once swept
away all idea of his being a native of Granada, and to an experienced
eye proclaimed him the retainer of some old English
family. Besides all this, there was an air of rather peculiar
nicety in his apparel. His cravat was richly ruffled with lace,
and flowed down ostentatiously over the waistcoat. His wristbands
were of the same costly material, with here and there a
slight fray or break, which gave suspicion of some previous and
more exalted ownership.</p>

<p class='c014'>He sat upon a little wooden bench, with the branches of a
fine mulberry tree bending over and protecting him from the
rising sun. Brushes and blacking lay near one end of the
bench, and on a drooping branch of the mulberry tree hung a
gentleman’s coat nicely brushed and left to the air.</p>

<p class='c014'>From the spotless purity of his dress, you would have believed
it impossible that this dainty-looking servant could have
been performing the menial services which these objects would
indicate; but at the very instant we present him to our readers,
Turner had his left hand thrust up to the sole of a delicately
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>shaped boot, and with the lightest and most graceful touch
imaginable, was polishing it. Now and then he paused, looked
at himself in the glittering surface, and fell to work again, not
quite satisfied that the beloved image was thrown back with
sufficient distinctness. He did not sing at his work. Turner
took everything quite too seriously for that; still he kept up a
faint, broken hum to the sound of his brush when in motion;
but sometimes paused all at once, and fell into a reverie, holding
the brush and boot in his hands, as if not entirely pleased
with his ruminations.</p>

<p class='c014'>At length the boot that he had been polishing seemed to be
susceptible of no further brilliancy, and after holding it up to
the sun and eyeing it with great satisfaction, he set it down,
muttering, “Now for the other!” He drew out from beneath
his bench the tattered and soiled mate, and held it up with
a disgustful shake of the head. “Alhambra dust—I’ll swear
to it—one, two, three—bah, it’s no use counting. Every night
up there——” Here he began to scatter the dust from his
master’s boots with angry vehemence.</p>

<p class='c014'>“In search of the picturesque—fond of ruins—who believes
it, I should like to know? One man don’t, I’m sure of that,
and his name is Turner, Thomas Turner, of Greenhurst, but
perhaps his opinion don’t amount to much; we shall see!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Here Turner worked on, pressing his thin lips hard, and
dashing away at the boot as if it had offended him mortally.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Out all night—the whole entire night—comes home at
break of day, and steals through old Turner’s room like a thief.
Thought the old man asleep, as if Turner ever slept when things
are going wrong with the boy.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Here the old man grew languid in his movements; his eyes
took a sadder expression, and his touch upon the boot was like
a caress.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Fear, why who knows what won’t come over him with
these doings? His coat soaked with dew and stuck full of
briars; his hair dripping with perspiration—everything at sixes
and sevens; and instead of sleeping when he does get home,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>rolling about on his bed and trying to cheat the old man; lets
him take away his clothes without saying a word; makes believe
he’s asleep, as if I didn’t see that forehead working as it always
does when things go wrong with him. He thinks to cheat old
Turner—fudge!”</p>

<p class='c014'>As the old man ceased, more and more earnest, his application
to the boot became exciting enough; his elbow went to and
fro like the play of a crank; his thin lips were gathered up into
a knot, and he looked sternly around upon the coat and mulberry
tree, as if challenging them to mortal combat.</p>

<p class='c014'>That moment the little impish figure of an old woman, with
a red kerchief twisted over her mummy-like forehead, and a
faded dress of the same color, came suddenly round a corner of
the Fonde, and stood eyeing him with a glance sharp and
vigilant, like that of a rattlesnake at rest.</p>

<p class='c014'>Turner gave her a sidelong look over the instep of his boot
as he held it up for inspection, but the weird sharpness of her
glance was too much, even for his immovable <i><span lang="fr">sang froid</span></i>. His
eyes sunk, and he began to gather up the brushes as if in preparation
for a retreat.</p>

<p class='c014'>The old woman came close up and addressed him in Spanish.
He understood the language well enough, but either from cunning,
or that inveterate hatred of everything French or Spanish
which we often find among English travelling servants, continued
gathering up his property as if he did not comprehend a
word.</p>

<p class='c014'>After uttering a few sentences, half cajoling, half imperative,
the woman turned away, muttering discontentedly between her
teeth, and was about entering the back door.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Halloo, where are you going now?” cried old Turner,
satisfied that silence would no longer answer his purpose.
“Where are you going, old witch? not into my lord’s room,
surely!”</p>

<p class='c014'>This was spoken in very respectable Spanish, though with a
sort of rude snappishness that mingled his hatred of the language
with every syllable.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>“So you <em>can</em> speak,” answered the woman, with an oath,
that springs to a gipsy’s lips naturally as flame leaps from
burning wood.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, I can speak your lingo when I choose to demean
myself particularly, and that isn’t often,” replied Turner, with
considerable vexation, that he had unwarily been drawn into
speaking the hated language. “But what do you want, old
beauty? Nothing of my lord, or old Turner, I hope?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I want the Busne.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“The what?” cried Turner, looking toward the door, and
kicking the brushes on one side.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The Busne.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And who on earth is that, my precious old nettle?”</p>

<p class='c014'>The old woman answered by a gesture of sharp impatience,
and moved toward the door.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Stop that,” cried Turner, placing himself on the narrow
threshold, and brandishing the glossy boot with one hand.
“No one passes in here till I know what his business is.
Speak up now, my precious old beauty. What’s your name?
Who do you want? What on earth do you mean by coming
here at all?”</p>

<p class='c014'>The old woman stood on the threshold alone, eyeing him
keenly, and glancing now and then with the cunning of her
race on each side of his person, to measure the possibility of
passing him. But Turner was equally vigilant, and manfully
kept his post, boot in hand.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Better come to terms at once: no one gets through here
without giving a passport, I can tell you that,” said Turner.
“Is it me you come after?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You!” sneered the old woman, and her thin lip curled
upward, revealing the sharp, hound-like teeth beneath. “You!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And why not, she-wolf? It wouldn’t be the first of
woman-kind that has run after the gentleman before you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I want the young gentlemen—the Busne who lodges here.
Let me go by, for I will see him!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Easy, easy,” persisted Turner, giving a semi-circular sweep
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>with his boot. “There is but one lodger here, and that is my
lord. You can’t see him, because he is in bed.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No matter: he must get up then!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Must get up!—now I like that—my master will like it—do
him good to hear the word <em>must</em>; hasn’t known the sound since
he was a creeping baby; still, and nevertheless, my sweet
witch of Endor, not having a fancy to get my head broken for
teaching forgotten lessons, I shan’t step from this spot till you
go back to the master who sent you, and just have the goodness
to say from old Turner, that we have given up all dealings
with him or his imps long ago.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I <em>will</em> see the Busne,” answered the Sibyl, clenching her
hand till it looked like a gnarled oak knot. “Curses rest upon
you—I will see him.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And just add by way of private information,” said Turner,
as if her last speech had escaped him entirely, “that if he has a
fancy to get us into mischief, there would be wisdom in sending
a younger face. It is astonishing how strong a man’s principles
become, what a deal of energy is given to his conscience
when temptation takes a shape like yours. The amount of
morality that lies in the contemplation of a face like a withered
prune, and a form like a good English faggot, is wonderful!”</p>

<p class='c014'>My great grandame was very, very aged. You will believe
it when I tell you that these jeers on her person had no effect
whatever. She did not even feel that they were intended for
her, but determined in her resolve to penetrate to the young
Englishman, she interrupted Turner’s philosophical soliloquy
with an impatient dash of her person toward the space left
open at his right hand. A slight scuffle ensued, in which the
gipsy buried her claw-like nails deep into the flesh of her antagonist’s
right arm, while he dropped the boot and grasped her
lean throat with a force that made the breath gurgle from her
lips.</p>

<p class='c014'>That instant the sound of a voice from within the Fonde
arrested the combatants, and after giving a farewell twist to
the old woman’s neck, and wrenching his arm from the grapple
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>of her fingers, which fell away with a blood tinge on the nails,
Turner flung her off and disappeared through a side door that
opened near the entrance.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XI.<br> <span class='large'>A TRAVELLER’S TOILET.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>In a little sleeping room, whitewashed till the walls looked
like a snow drift, and carpeted with thick rush matting, he
found Lord Clare sitting upon the side of a low camp bed, and
looking hopelessly around for the garments which we have seen
fluttering upon the mulberry boughs, and in the possession of
Turner. A beautiful dressing-case, with its rich apparatus of
gold, lay open on a little table. Above it hung a very small and
very uncertain mirror, which gave to the beholder’s face the
effect of a slight paralytic shock, sending one corner of the
mouth shooting up toward the eyes, and another wandering off
in search of the left shoulder. Lord Clare had evidently
attempted to commence his own toilet, but one glance at the
mirror, which appalled him with the apparition of a maniac
leering over a razor, which he was brandishing as if to cut his
own throat, terminated his labors at the first stage.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Turner, take that glass away,” said the young lord, as his
servant entered, “and bring me something that will throw
back the features of a Christian. This makes me look like a
fiend.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I shouldn’t wonder,” muttered the servant, “everything is
going crooked with us; and perhaps the looking-glass gives
back the truth nearer than we calculate.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What are you saying, Turner?” questioned the young lord,
in that quiet, gentle tone with which very proud men are apt
to address inferiors.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>“A little private conversation between me and the looking-glass,
my lord; nothing else.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It must be a very distorted argument,” said the master,
smiling; “but, Turner, I heard voices at the door—what was
it? You seemed disputing with some one.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Nothing of the sort my lord. I don’t know any one in
this pestilential country worth disputing with.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But surely there was more than your voice; I heard
another distinctly, and it seemed like that of a woman.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Of a fiend, my lord—an imp of darkness—an old she-wolf.
Look, here are the marks of her claws on my arm; they bit
through to the bone.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“A gipsy woman?” asked Lord Clare, turning pale; “an
old weird creature that looks like a child withered to the bone.
Was that the person who assailed you?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Exactly, my lord, I couldn’t have drawn her portrait better.
You may hear her prowling about the door yet; but no fear,
two bolts are drawn between us!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And what does she want?” asked Lord Clare, in a low and
agitated voice.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Your lordship, nothing less,” replied Turner.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Is she alone?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Visibly, yes; but heaven only knows how many of her
infernal sisterhood may swarm around her in the air.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Does she seem excited—unusually so?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Here is an endorsement for that,” replied Turner, stretching
forth his arm, and touching the sleeve of his coat, through
which a drop or two of blood had oozed.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Bring my clothes here, and when I am dressed let her come
in,” said Lord Clare, abruptly; “I must see her—I must know
what has been done,” he added, in an under tone. “Thank
heaven! the terrible suspense will be over.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Turner hesitated, he evidently had some dislike of encountering
the Sibyl again, valiant as he was.</p>

<p class='c014'>“If I open the door she will rush in—the old hyena.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, no, address her mildly,” answered Clare; “say that I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>will receive her the moment my toilet is made. If she is restive,
pacify her with a piece of gold; but go at once, I am impatient
for this scene to be over.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Turner looked at his coat-sleeve, shook his head, and cautiously
undid the bolt. As he had expected, the Sibyl stood
outside in the passage, her eyes blazing with fury, her whole
frame quivering with impatient wrath.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Not yet, my diamond of Golconda,” said Turner, putting
her back with his left hand, while he locked the door and drew
forth the key. “Cultivate patience, darling, it is a Christian
virtue, very respectable and worth having; anybody’s servant
in England can tell you that.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Your master, the Busne. Have you told him I am here?”
inquired the Sibyl, subduing her evil nature into a vicious
wheedle more repulsive than open malice.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, I have told him the honor intended.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What did he say?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“That you are to take this piece of gold to gloat over while
he is dressing!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And then he will see me?” cried the old woman tossing the
gold away as if in contempt of a bribe. “Tell him I am the
widow of a count!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“He feels the honor, no doubt—I have had touching
proofs.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Turner glanced at his arm, and then at the old woman’s
throat. The dusky red which circled it like a collar satisfied
him. He turned away chuckling, and went forth to collect his
master’s garments.</p>

<p class='c014'>The moment he was gone the old gipsy turned her eyes upon
the guinea that she had cast aside. Her fingers began to
work; a cold gloating light came into her eyes, and creeping
toward the gold as if it had been a serpent fascinating her, she
clutched it eagerly, and buried it deep in her bosom.</p>

<p class='c014'>When Turner came back he saw that the gold had disappeared,
and, smiling grimly, entered his lord’s chamber, satisfied
that the Sibyl was quieted for a time at least.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>A less keen observer than his old valet might have seen that
Lord Clare was greatly agitated while his toilet was in progress.
He moved restlessly; his cheeks blazed and faded by
turns; his voice grew sharp and imperative, a thing which
Turner scarcely ever remembered to have witnessed before.
He seemed particularly annoyed by the valet’s rather stubborn
desire to elaborate his dress, and finally ordered Turner to
bring in the Sibyl and leave him.</p>

<p class='c014'>This injunction was anything but satisfactory to the old man.
Both in manner and substance it was annoying. He felt that
the key to all the mysterious movements of his master, during
the last month, lay in the Sibyl, who so peremptorily claimed
audience of his master. Turner was greatly puzzled and highly
displeased. He felt as if his master and the gipsy were depriving
him of his just rights and natural perquisites in thus
securing a private interview. He went forth muttering his
discontent. The old woman’s inflamed throat gave him a
gleam of comfort, and satisfying himself more and more that
she was a dangerous person to be left alone with his master,
he stationed himself very close to the door after she entered, so
close that a suspicious person might have supposed him listening,
especially as he had left the door very slightly ajar.</p>

<p class='c014'>But my great grandame outmatched him over and over
again in this sort of cunning. Before advancing into the room
where the Englishman sat waiting for her, she closed the door
and drew a bolt inside, at which Turner flung indignantly away,
and took his seat on a bench beneath his lord’s window, which
was open, and the muslin curtain flowing softly over it.</p>

<p class='c014'>But scarcely had he seated himself when the window was
shut down with a crash, and the curtains drawn close. Then
Turner fell back against the side of the house, and struggled
with the Sibyl no longer, satisfied, as most men are who essay
the experiment, that in a fair struggle of wit, tact, or management,
few men ever come out successfully against a woman,
young or old, fair or otherwise.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XII.<br> <span class='large'>TEMPTATIONS AND RESOLUTIONS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Meantime the old gipsy stood face to face with the Englishman,
who regarded her with an appearance of ease which an
anxious gleam of the eyes contradicted.</p>

<p class='c014'>“One word,” he said, breaking through all restraints as she
was about to address him—“one word before you speak of
other things. Is Aurora safe? Is it to tell me this, or ask
her at my hands that you come?”</p>

<p class='c014'>The Sibyl was pleased with his agitation and his eagerness.
It promised well for her mission.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Aurora is safe!” she answered, and it was wonderful how
the usual fierce tones of her voice were modulated. Nothing
could be more respectful, nay, winning, than her every look and
tone. “Aurora is safe as yet—but our people have arisen;
they will not be satisfied till her blood reddens the Valley of
Stones.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But you—you—oh, heavens—you cannot see this done.
Poor child, she is innocent as a flower.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“They do not believe it!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But you believe it—her grandame—you will be his
friend.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“There is but one way—only one in the world, I have come
to say this. You alone can save her from the fury of our
tribe!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“How can I save her? Point out the way, and if it is to
purchase her life with my own, speak, and I will do it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You must leave Granada to-night, and take my grandchild
with you!”</p>

<p class='c014'>The young man’s eyes fell, and the rich color burned, like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>fire, in his cheeks; but he remembered the scene that had
passed that night in the Alhambra, and shook his head.</p>

<p class='c014'>“She will not go! I could not persuade her to be saved on
these terms,” he said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, not on the terms you are thinking of. I would see
her torn limb from limb before my eyes; yea, help to rend her
to death, rather than see her live the shame of her people; but
there is another way. Sometimes the rich men of our people
have married among the Gentiles. If men take that privilege,
it belongs to our women also. Make Aurora your wife according
to the marriage rites of the tribe; go with her privately to
your own country—leave the old woman gold enough to keep
her from starving, and she will be content.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But would this appease your tribe? Would they again
receive Aurora?” questioned the young man.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No; they believe her a castaway; marriage would be no
atonement. I know that she is not the thing they suspect; but
it would be of no use attempting to convince them. Do what
I wish, and they will believe her dead. They cannot take from
me the right of a count’s widow to punish those of her own
blood with her own hands, privately or not as she wills. They
will think that I have given her of the drao, and that she lies
in the bottom of the Darro.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The young man was greatly agitated. He paced the room
to and fro; then he sat down, veiling his eyes with his hand,
and fell into labored thought. At length he lifted his eyes to
the old woman, who had been regarding him all the time in
anxious and vigilant silence.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Will Aurora consent to this?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Will the ring-dove fly to her covert when she sees the
fowler’s gun pointed to her breast?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Last night she left me in anger!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Since last night she has felt what would have withered
common hearts to a cinder,” replied the Sibyl. “At sunset she
was a child! The morning light found her a woman. Like an
earthquake, terror and suffering have turned all the fresh soil
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>of her nature uppermost. She is of the pure blood, and that
is old and strong as wine that has been forgotten centuries in
a vault.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But if I consent to your plan—which certainly promises
safety to the poor child—it will be but the very thing in
fact that I myself proposed last night. No marriage ceremony
which you recognize would be held binding among my people.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What have we to do with your people? What do we
care if they recognize our marriage rites or not?” answered
the Sibyl, haughtily. “It is not their opinion that we regard,
but our own. If <em>I</em> am content—I, her nearest relative—who
shall dare to cast scorn upon my child, because she defies all
laws but those of her own people?”</p>

<p class='c014'>For a moment the young man’s eyes flashed; but the excitement
was momentary. His face became grave and stern; his
heart grew heavy, and he shrunk within himself as a proud
nature always must, when it comes in possession of a wrong
wish.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Understand me perfectly,” he said. “If I submit to this
ceremony, whatever it may be, it will not be considered a
marriage among my countrymen. Aurora will never be received
as my wife—have no claim on my property save that
which I may, of my own free consent, bestow, and in all things
her position must depend on my will, my sense of honor. She
will not even be looked on with respect; I can give her home,
shelter, gold, affection, care, but my wife she cannot be.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What Gitana ever was respected by the Busne? We are
not fools enough to demand it,” said the old woman bitterly.
“As for your laws, we despise them—your gold, surely no
woman of our people desires more than her husband chooses
to give; your whole nation—what is it to us but a curse and
a thing to be abhorred? Could my poor Aurora go back
to her tribe in safety, you should not have her for a ton’s
weight of the yellowest gold ever sifted from the Darro. No,
I ask that ceremony which we hold binding, nothing more, save
that I may not be left to starve, and Aurora is yours.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>“But I shall be free by the law to marry another,” said the
young man, forcing himself to lay all the painful points of
the case before the Sibyl, thus relieving the clamors of his
conscience.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You <em>dare</em> not marry another, law or no law. Aurora is
of my blood,” answered the Sibyl, and the blaze of her fiery
heart broke over her face. “A strong will makes its own
laws and defends its own rights. You dare not marry another,
she will not permit it. I will not.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Heaven forbid that my sweet Gitanilla should ever inherit
the fierce nature of her grandame, or my chances of happiness
were small, indeed,” said the Englishman, inly. Then addressing
the Sibyl, he added, almost solemnly, “no man should
promise for himself in the future. I am powerless to answer
for my conduct to your grandchild beyond the present feelings
of my heart, the immediate promptings of my conscience. It
seems to me now impossible that I should ever wrong the
trust you both place in me—impossible that any other should
ever step between her heart and mine. God only knows what
is in the future,” he continued, with mournful sadness, “or how
the past may break in and color it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He seemed about sinking into a reverie, one of those to
which he had been accustomed, and which gave a serious
cast to a character naturally ardent and impulsive. But the
old gipsy grew impatient, and broke in with something of
her native asperity, which had been kept in abeyance during
the entire conversation.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is getting late—have you decided, Busne?” she said,
without once removing her eyes, which had been reading him
to the soul. Doubts, struggles, hesitations, all that went to
make up the flood of contending feelings that raged beneath
his calm, almost sad exterior, she had been keenly regarding.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I <em>have</em> decided,” answered the young man, in a firm, but
very sad voice, “God knows I would have saved her otherwise,
if possible! When and where must this ceremony take place?
Not in presence of the tribe; that I cannot submit to.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>The gipsy uttered one of her sharp, bitter laughs.</p>

<p class='c014'>“They would kill her and you. No, no, they will think
her dead. Before dawn we went out together; I shall go
home <em>alone</em>—they will understand. It is not the first time
that old Papita has done that, and always after, those who
sought, have found traces of her work—I shall leave them now.
Fragments of Aurora’s dress are clinging to the brambles
where the Darro runs deepest. They will find footsteps also
ground into the soil, and tangles of black hair. They know
Aurora’s hair by the purple gloss.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But she, Aurora, tell me what you have done with her?”
inquired the young man, half terrified by these details.</p>

<p class='c014'>“She is safe. When the night comes, be ready, and I will
take you where she is.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“At what hour?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Close to midnight, when you see the fires go out along the
Barranco, expect me.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I will.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Have mules in readiness, and a disguise for the Gitanilla;
something that our people may not fathom readily.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It will be easy,” said Clare, after a moment’s thought;
“my page died on the coast—Turner must have his garments
somewhere among my luggage—I will speak with him.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Gold will be wanted,” said the gipsy, fixing her hungry
glance on the young man with a meaning he could not possibly
misunderstand. He stepped to a desk that lay in its leather
case in a corner of the room, and took out several rolls of English
guineas, enough to fill one hand.</p>

<p class='c014'>“When you want more, here is an address; ask freely.
Would to God all else were as easy as this,” he said, muttering
the latter words in his own language, and placing a strip of
paper, on which he had hastily written, in her hand.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Sibyl’s eyes gleamed, and for the first time he saw a
smile of genuine satisfaction flash over her face.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh! this is something like: the Busne is magnificent,” she
exclaimed, eagerly concealing the gold in her dress. “Now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>they cannot starve old Papita like a sick hound in its kennel—this
is power, and she can defy them. Let them question her
if they dare—let them revile her if they have the courage, and
say her grandchild had the death of shame. What does Papita
care while she has gold and the drao secret.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The young man smiled faintly. He could not comprehend
this fierce passion for gain in a creature left tottering upon the
brink of her grave so long, with all her bad passions still
retaining their keen edge. He, to whom wealth came freely as
the air, could little understand how want and penury, from
which in this world gold alone can save us, grinds down the
most generous nature. He despised the old gipsy woman in his
soul; but had he suffered as she had done, in what might he
have been superior? It is easy to scorn the sin to which we
have no temptation.</p>

<p class='c014'>Eager to count over her gold—more than satisfied with her
morning’s success, my great grandame left the Fonde chuckling
to herself, and hugging her treasure with both arms fondly as a
mother caresses her child. On her way down the hill she met
Turner, who eyed her like an angry mastiff, and muttered to
himself in English something that she did not understand. He
stood looking after her as she disappeared among the trees, but
she was busy with her gold, and cared nothing for his scrutiny.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Turner,” said Lord Clare, as that functionary entered the
Fonde.</p>

<p class='c014'>“My lord!” was the terse reply, and by the very tone in
which it was uttered Clare saw that the moment was unpropitious
for his orders, and he gave them, with a faint blush and
some hesitation.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Turner, you will settle with the people here; pack up, and
be ready to start at a moment’s notice.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Which way, my lord?”</p>

<p class='c014'>When Turner was out of sorts his words were very few, and
those few came forth with jerks, as if he plucked them up one
by one from the depths of his bosom.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I—I have not quite determined. Across to Malija, perhaps.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>“Humph!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“This does not seem to please you, Turner.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What right has a servant to be pleased, I should like to
know?” was the gruff rejoinder.</p>

<p class='c014'>“When an old servant is a faithful friend too, we like to see
him satisfied,” said Clare, in a voice that no woman could have
resisted. But Turner felt his advantage. He saw that his
master kept something back which he hesitated to speak out,
and so resolved not to soften his embarrassment in the least.</p>

<p class='c014'>“We shall require three saddle mules, the best that can be
found in Granada,” said the master, at length.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Three! humph!” ejaculated Turner again.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And others for the luggage,” persisted the young man,
more decidedly.</p>

<p class='c014'>Turner bowed stiffly. He understood this change in his
master’s tone, and did not like to brave him beyond a certain
point. After a moment Clare spoke again.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You have the clothes that the boy William left, I suppose?”
he said, but without looking his old serving man in the face as
usual.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, I have them, my lord.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Very well—leave them out—they will be wanted. I take
a new page with me from hence.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Turner did not speak now, but his features fell, and with a
grave air, perfectly respectful, but full of rebuke, he stood
looking at his young master.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Have you a wish to discharge old Turner?” said the servant,
at length, choking back the emotions that seemed forcing
the words from his throat.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Discharge you, Turner; why, you wouldn’t go if I did,”
cried the young lord, forcing a laugh.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Humph!” groaned the old man; “perhaps it will be vice
versa—who knows?”</p>

<p class='c014'>The blood rushed into Lord Clare’s face, but before he could
speak, Turner left the room.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XIII.<br> <span class='large'>THE WEIRD WEDDING.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“Turner!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“My lord!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Have you prepared the dress I spoke of?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is ready: what shall I do with it, my master?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Leave it in my room. The preparations, are they all
made?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“All.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And you will be ready to start at a moment’s warning,
night or day?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“The mules are saddled now; every thing packed!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is well; I shall not want you again for some hours. As
we leave Granada so soon, you may have friends to part with,
something to purchase. Go into the city if you desire.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Thank you, my lord!” replied Turner, with more than
ordinary meekness; “I am much obliged by the permission.”
The young earl looked up suddenly. There was a dryness in
Turner’s voice that he did not like, but the immovable face of
the old man revealed nothing. He touched his hat with military
brevity and moved away, measuring his long strides down
the avenue with a slow regularity that marked all his movements.</p>

<p class='c014'>Lord Clare looked after him anxiously, and muttering to
himself, “Well, well, we must manage him some way,” entered
the Fonde, and spent some hours alone in his room walking to
and fro, and tortured with those thousand wild dreams that
haunt an imaginative person so like demons when the great
epochs of life are close at hand. The sunset paled around him,
and night came more darkly than is usual in that climate.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>Still he ordered no lights, but placing the bundle of page’s garments
on the table near his elbow, sat down and waited in
sombre silence.</p>

<p class='c014'>To reveal all the thoughts that flowed through his mind,
one must have known his previous life, and of that even to this
day I am not informed. Nay, who is ever informed of those
acts which give the well-springs of thought in any human
being? Men and women live together under the same roof, sit
at the same board, and talk of knowing each other’s hearts,
feelings, lives. At the Day of Judgment when all hearts
will be read, fold by fold, like the leaves of a book, how will
these persons be astonished at the unspoken feelings, the
unimagined acts that have marked the lives, and burned themselves
upon the hearts with which they believed themselves so
familiar.</p>

<p class='c014'>Lord Clare sat motionless now, for he was waiting with that
intense anxiety which makes one’s own breath a torment,
because it disturbs the stillness with which we desire to envelop
ourselves when listening. At length he heard a step, soft
and cat-like, stealing through the passage. Then the door of
his room opened, and in the darkness he saw two eyes glowing
upon him like those of a tiger, when the rest of its body is
concealed among the dusky limbs of a forest tree.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Come,” said the voice of old Papita, “it is time.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Lord Clare started up and moved toward the door.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The clothes, give me the disguise,” whispered the Sibyl;
“where is it?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Without waiting for a reply, she put forth her claw-like
hands, felt her way to the table, and grasped the bundle.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Come, come,” she whispered, seizing Lord Clare by the
hand.</p>

<p class='c014'>It seemed to him as if his hand were grasped by the claw of
a demon, so hard, dry and hot were those fingers as they
clutched his; and as he stooped that she might whisper in his
ear, the hot breath that passed over his cheek made him shudder.
She led him out back of the Fonde amid broken timbers,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>loose rocks and rubbish of every description: she scrambled
on, dragging him after her, till they stood by a wooden door
opening, as it seemed, into the embankment behind the Fonde.</p>

<p class='c014'>Papita pushed at this door, and it gave way, revealing the
mouth of a subterranean passage choked up with darkness.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Come quickly, or some one may be on the watch,” whispered
the Sibyl, for Lord Clare had hesitated at this forbidding
entrance.</p>

<p class='c014'>He was a brave man, but at this instant many stories of
gipsy vengeance flashed through his mind, and his companion
was not one to reconcile these doubts. There was something
too impish and unearthly in her for that.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Do you fear? the Busne is brave,” said the Sibyl scornfully—for
even interest could not always keep down her malice—“like
a gipsy baby, afraid of the dark!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Peace, woman. It is not fear; but I go into this place
only when I am certain what it contains, and where it ends,”
replied the earl, firmly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It contains Aurora, and it ends in the palace of the Alhambra,”
answered the Sibyl, promptly. “It was through this
passage that the last Moorish king, Boabdil, left the Alhambra
forever. You stand upon the very earth where he came forth
to the day which he had learned to curse.”</p>

<p class='c014'>A deeper gloom fell upon Lord Clare. He looked upward.
The black, rugged towers of the Alhambra loomed between
him and the sky. Clouds hung low upon them, and the dim
trees were thick and pall like, blacking the night below him.</p>

<p class='c014'>The unfortunate Moorish king seemed near by. Never, perhaps,
had history pressed so close upon a human heart. Lord
Clare for a moment forgot his own position, the Sibyl, Aurora,
everything in his intense realization of the past.</p>

<p class='c014'>“In, in,” exclaimed the Sibyl. “I see a man creeping round
yon corner of the Fonde; we have no time. If you fear, stay
behind: the men of our people know how to avenge themselves
in the day time as well as in the dark.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Have done—have done,” exclaimed the earl, sharply, “how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>can you judge of my thoughts? I trust you in nothing, but am
sure of myself. If you play me false I will shoot you like a
dog, woman or no woman; so move on and only speak when
you have something to say.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He entered the passage speaking, and the next moment was
engulphed with his weird companion in thick darkness.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Truly, Thomas Turner, my estimable friend, you have got
a sad fool for a master, that is a dead certainty!” muttered old
Turner, for it was his figure the sharp eye of the Sibyl had discovered—“to
trust himself now with this old vagrant—to plunge
headforemost into that black pit with the imp of Satan for a
guide. It’s enough to make one’s heart leap into his mouth
and freeze there. But of course it’s the bounden duty of a
good servant to follow his master. Thomas Turner, you are a
good servant, everybody admits that. Therefore, Thomas, my
friend, follow—follow like a brave fellow as you are!”</p>

<p class='c014'>With these words, Turner, who was in truth a brave fellow,
drew his travelling pistol, settled the lock, and holding it in his
right hand, stole cautiously into the passage.</p>

<p class='c014'>Nothing could have been better calculated to daunt even a
brave man than the profound stillness, the palpable blackness of
this subterranean passage. Turner had proceeded only a few
paces when he felt that like a cavern it had its compartments and
its intricate windings—steps to ascend and descend. Then to
his dismay he found that it branched off into vaults, and what
appeared to be dungeons or secret chambers for concealment.
He paused and listened. Nothing was heard, not even the
sweet gush of waters that in Granada are ever present like the
sunshine or the breeze. All was profound stillness. No footstep,
no voice. Deep midnight and those solid stone walls surrounded
him alone. He groped about, advancing he knew not
whither, tempted every moment to call aloud, though certain
that this rash act must defeat his own object.</p>

<p class='c014'>At last, completely bewildered, he held forth his pistol, and
with a finger on the trigger was about to fire, that at least he
might have the benefit of a flash to guide his course. But that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>moment a faint sound reached his ear. He dropped his hand,
listened, and moved on. Yes, it was a light, the faintest possible
gleam breaking over the rugged corner of a wall, but it
burned steadily enough to guide him onward.</p>

<p class='c014'>He moved cautiously, for now the faint hum of voices came
stealing through the vaulted passage, and he knew that the
slightest mistake might expose his presence. Reaching an
angle of the wall, he crept into its shadow and held his breath.
Before him was a small chamber, or it might be merely an enlargement
of the passage. An antique house lamp, rust eaten
and moist with mould, hung from the ceiling, evidently trimmed
for the first time in years, for the flame was half buried in
clouds of smoke; and drops of the olive oil, with which it had
just been filled, rolled down the chased sides, leaving a green
path in the rust.</p>

<p class='c014'>In this strange, murky light a group of persons were standing
around a fragment of black marble, in which Turner, with
difficulty, traced the outlines of some very ancient sculpture,
like that which in his travels he had seen on Egyptian idols.
Two other persons besides the Sibyl were present, both in
strange garments, and unlike the class of persons he had yet
seen in any province of Spain. But Turner scarcely gave them
a thought. His attention was too eagerly fixed on Lord Clare,
who stood before the platform on which the idol had been
lifted, holding a young girl, undoubtedly of gipsy blood, by the
hand.</p>

<p class='c014'>From their attitude they must have just risen from a kneeling
posture, and some ceremony seemed just concluded. What
the ceremony could be which had brought his master, the
withered Sibyl, those strange men and that wildly beautiful
girl around that mutilated form of black marble, Turner could
not even imagine. But the whole scene was weird and strange
enough for the wildest conjecture. The Sibyl stood forward
directly under the lamp. The smoke wreathed in clouds around
the fiery red folds of her turban. Her saya was edged knee
deep with the richest gold lace, bright in broad flashes, then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>tarnished to a green hue, but still of unique splendor; her
ear-rings glowed over those mummy-like shoulders like drops
of congealed blood. The exulting brightness of her eyes was
terrific. She looked so like an evil spirit that poor Turner
absolutely believed her to be one, who had cast some infernal
charm upon his master.</p>

<p class='c014'>He shrunk away crowding himself hard against the wall,
but still with his eyes fixed on the group. Lord Clare was
very pale, and the grim light made this pallor and the excitement
in his eyes almost unearthly. A look of painful disgust
was on his features, like that of a man who loathes the thing
he has forced himself to do. Once he dropped the Gitanilla’s
hand, looking wearily around as if for something to sit down
upon.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XIV.<br> <span class='large'>THE GITANILLA’S OATH.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Then for the first time Turner saw the eyes of my mother,
those wonderful, glorious eyes, fiery as a star, soft as the dew
in a flower They were lifted to Clare’s face, fondly, wonderingly,
as if she marvelled that he could thus break the delicious
joy that thrilled her heart and soul. There was something
of lingering terror yet in her face, but so blended with the
wild, deep passion of her love, that it kindled up her features
like lightning. The old woman was regarding her not with
tenderness, that was impossible. If she had any, it lay so deep
in that rocky old heart that no ripple of it ever disturbed the
hardness of her features.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Gitanilla drew toward her, took her rigid fingers, and
pressed them to her lips and forehead. She uttered a few
words in a tongue unknown to Turner, and tears crowded
one after another into her great bright eyes. They must have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>been full of passionate feeling, for the hard, keen eyes of
the Sibyl grew strangely dim, and with her hand she put
back the jetty waves from my mother’s forehead, making the
sign of some strange writing upon its bloodless surface.</p>

<p class='c014'>They stood together thus, the bright red flounces of their
sayas mingling in waves of gold lace and heavy crimson. The
blue bodice of the girl pressed to the jet black velvet that
clung to the form of the Sibyl like the fragment of some
funeral pall. There was something terrible in their appearance.
The old woman’s arms clung around that lithe form
with serpentlike folds. Her turban blended, like waves of fire,
with those raven tresses. It seemed like the embrace of a
demon. For the lamp whirled and flared overhead, swinging
to some concealed current of wind, and the smoke flung around
them a dusky veil, now of heavy grey, now threaded with
fire by the unsteady flame. Besides this, was the contrast
of her rich youth with that terrible thing, a wicked old age.</p>

<p class='c014'>No wonder Turner shrunk against the wall, and grew chilly
without knowing why. No wonder Lord Clare was aroused
from all the feelings that had enchained him till now! He
started forward, and would have taken my mother from the
embrace of her last and only relative. But the old woman thrust
him aside, and spoke eagerly with the grand-daughter in the
Rommany tongue; and in this tongue my mother answered her.</p>

<p class='c014'>Shall I tell you what she was saying? My mother left
me a record in the fragments of her journal. The Sibyl first
urged her to win the Busne to the sending of more and more
gold; then she extorted a promise, a fearful promise, which
the poor girl kept but too faithfully.</p>

<p class='c014'>When the Sibyl relinquished my mother from her embrace,
the poor child staggered and fell away from her arms like a
crushed lily. Her lips were violet color; her face more than
bloodless. She seemed to be dying.</p>

<p class='c014'>Lord Clare took her in his arms and laid her face upon his
bosom. It was beautiful to see the warm flood of life come
back to the mysterious influence of his touch. Her lips grew
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>bright as strawberries; and tears rolled from her half-closed
eyes, dropping like dew upon the peachy bloom of her cheek.
You could see her tremble from head to foot, so deep, so
passionate were the feelings that flooded her young being with
their delicious joy.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Sibyl looked on with grim satisfaction, but the two
strange men seemed to expostulate with her, or to ask some
directions. She answered them haughtily, and touching the
ruby ear-rings with her finger, pointed down the passage.</p>

<p class='c014'>They obeyed at once, each bending his head submissively
as he passed the old woman. I do not know how far those
ruby ear-rings were symbols of authority, but my great
grandame had some mysterious claim of obedience from the
descendants of those few of her people who aided her ancestress
in the betrayal of Maria de Padilla, and the two men
were all of our tribe who could boast of the treacherous blood
that had persuaded that heroic woman to her terrible death.
They believed that obedience unto death was due the last
descendant of the arch-sorceress, who had most effectually
worked out their national hate against the whites. To them
the ruby ear-rings were a symbol of absolute power. Had
my great grandame commanded them to leap into the Darro
without a struggle for life, they would have done it. She
only imposed secrecy, craft, and unscrupulous falsehood, and
those things came so naturally that it required little authority
to enforce them.</p>

<p class='c014'>These men passed Turner without seeing him. He did not
heed them, but still watched the persons who remained standing
near the Egyptian idol.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Sibyl stood directly before Lord Clare, who still half
supported her grand-daughter. Now her manner was imposing,
her energy sublime; the sorceress blood seemed to glow and
burn in her veins as she spoke. It was to Lord Clare she addressed
herself, not to the girl. The whispered words that had
withered her cheek and lip, were all the farewell admonition
she had to give her: but that which she said to Clare had the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>same effect. Aurora shook with terror as her relative uttered
her last—it might almost be called malediction.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Go,” she said—“go, and with you take the last drop of
my blood that burns in a human heart. Take her—keep faith
with her, nor dream that this marriage is less binding than if
all the high priests of Spain and of your land, wherever it may
be, had celebrated it in the great cathedral down yonder, with
the high altar in a blaze of light, and the tomb of Queen Isabella
giving sanctity to the spot. Look at your wife, how her
eyes dwell upon you—how full of hope and trust they are—how
wildly she wishes to be free from this dim vault, alone with
you, and away from her last of kin. The blossoms that live
half in sunshine, half in snow, on the Sierra Nevada, are not
more stainless than this child. The hot sun that ripens the
orange on the Guadalquivir is not more fervent than her passionate
nature—more burning than her pride. Be just to the
child, or beware of the woman. She is in your hands; make of
her what you will, a gazelle or a tiger, the thing you call an
angel, or the thing you fear as a fiend. That which you make
her she will be, a blessing or a curse, which will cling to you for
ever and ever. Free to act, free to marry, these were your
words twelve hours ago. This you believed, and I, the old
gipsy, mocked at your folly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“In England, you say, and here with us, marriages are alike
binding unto death—death, and nothing but death, can separate
you from this child. You have sworn it before my god;
she has sworn it before her god; and I have sworn by all the
eternal powers that exist, high or low. Hope not to shake off
Papita’s oath, or your own. Your laws—all the laws of this
nation or yours are but shadows against the stern will of a
woman whom nature has made strong, and treason has left
desperate.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I looked for the stars to-night. They were troubled, buried
in clouds, pale and half extinguished in vapor, as the Darro
flings them back when it is turbid and muddy. So it always
is when I would read her fate and yours. That bespeaks”——</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>“Stay!” said the earl, sternly, “you are killing her—see
how white she is—how she trembles. Why torture her in this
way, it can do no good?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I declare to you again I feel it in my soul, and read it in
the stars, nothing but death shall separate you from this, my
grand-daughter. Swear it again!”</p>

<p class='c014'>She spoke to Aurora, who either from weakness, or obeying
the Sibyl’s gesture, laid her hand on the forehead of the Egyptian
idol, and her white lips moved as if uttering some inward
vow. Turner saw this, but Lord Clare mistook the sudden
recoil as an evidence of exhaustion, and with a flushed cheek
sought to protect her from further persecution.</p>

<p class='c014'>“This has gone too far,” he said; “I will submit no longer.
Make what preparations you will, but in haste, for the night is
wearing on.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is enough,” answered the Sibyl. “I have said my say,
and the oath is sworn.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Be in haste,” answered the earl impatiently, drawing forth
his watch. “It is now past midnight.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The old woman drew aside, and by the smoky light Turner
saw that she was searching for something in the folds of her
dress.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Here,” she said, coming forth, “this trinket may be worth
something to you. Our people would have crushed it up for
the gold, but I would not let them.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She held it in her hand, so that the light fell directly upon
an exquisite little miniature formed like a shell, which the
reader will remember as a portion of the plunder which Chaleco
brought from his expedition to Seville. That side of the
case was open which held the female portrait, and the light fell
with peculiar brightness upon the features.</p>

<p class='c014'>As Lord Clare saw it he recoiled, drew a sharp breath, and
the sudden paleness that crept over his face was terrible.</p>

<p class='c014'>“This, and in your hands?” he said, in a husky voice, fixing
his enlarged eyes on the Sibyl. “How dare you, fiend—how
dare you?”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>The old woman gave a low hiss with her tongue, and looking
hard at Aurora, said, in a clear, sharp tone, “Remember the
oath; you will have need; remember this face too.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Lord Clare snatched the miniature from her hand with a
violence that made the case shut with a snap, that seemed like
the click of a pistol before it goes off. But my mother had
seen the face, and though it made little impression at the time,
when everything seemed like a dream, she remembered it in
after years.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Now,” said the earl, more fiercely than he had spoken before
that night, “prepare her at once, I will remain here no
longer.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The old woman withdrew, leading my mother with her. They
went into some side passage, and Turner lost sight of them, for
he was too deeply interested in the movements of Lord Clare to
leave his position.</p>

<p class='c014'>The earl watched till they were out of sight, then sat down
with his back against the idol, opened the miniature, gave one
glance, shut it again, and bent his forehead upon the hand in
which it was clenched. Thus he remained motionless till a
sound of footsteps aroused him, when he sprang up, thrust the
miniature in his bosom, and stood calm and immovable as a
statue, ready to receive his wife. I call her his wife, and never,
never while there is breath in my bosom, will I, her child, his
child, admit that she was not. Are not our laws as sacred as
those of England?</p>

<p class='c014'>My mother came forward clad in the pretty attire of an English
page, and so disguised, so full of that beautiful, shrinking
modesty which true women always feel when presented in a
doubtful position before a beloved object, that it could not fail
to arouse Lord Clare from the stupor that had fallen upon
him. He smiled faintly as she came forward, and drawing her
arm through his, followed the Sibyl down the subterranean
passage, guided by a small lamp that had stood before the
Egyptian idol. They came out into the fresh night, on the
very spot where the Moorish King gave up the splendor of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>life. Lord Clare thought of this, and his heart grew heavy
again.</p>

<p class='c014'>Turner followed with long, noiseless strides, and gliding
behind the Fonde like a shadow, stood by the mules which had
been drawn up beneath the thick trees ready to receive the
party.</p>

<p class='c014'>An hour after, my poor mother was looking back to obtain
one more last glimpse of Granada, and the gipsy Sibyl sat
alone in her cave with a heap of gold in her lap, counting it
over and over by the dim light that struggled down from a
niche in the smoky wall.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XV.<br> <span class='large'>THE MANSION AND THE COTTAGE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The first bright picture upon my memory was of Greenhurst,
Lord Clare’s ancestral home. It rests in my mind a background
of gorgeous and hazy confusion, indistinct and mellow
as a sunset cloud. Then comes a misty outline of distant
mountains melting into the more clearly defined middle distance,
and in the foreground a beautiful stream sleeping beneath
old trees, sparkling through the hollows, and spreading out
like a lake in the green meadows. A lawn rose softly upward
from the banks of this river, broad and green as emerald. If
you parted the soft grass, an undergrowth of the finest moss
met your view like velvet beneath a wealth of embroidery.
Clumps of trees shaded the lawn here and there, and on either
hand, so far as the eye could reach, a park of magnificent old
chestnuts, with a fine variety of oaks, filled the eye with the
vast wealth of their foliage.</p>

<p class='c014'>A dozen avenues led through this park, some of them miles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>in length, and almost all commanded some view of the old
mansion. One revealed a gable cutting picturesquely against
the sky; another commanded the back entrance, with its massive
stonework, burdened with heavy armorial bearings, and
heaped with quarterings till the herald office itself would have
been puzzled to unravel them. A third opened upon the east
wing, with its broad bay windows curving into old stone balconies
covered with ponderous sculpture, its antique casements
filled with single sheets of plate glass which shone through the
ivy like flashes of a river between the trees that fringe it—thus
was blended all that is gay and cheerful in our times with the
sombre magnificence of the long ago, beautifully as we find
the sunshine pouring its glory into the dark bosom of a forest.</p>

<p class='c014'>This view I remember best, for it was the first object that
ever fastened itself upon my memory. A waste of flower-beds,
clumps of rich trees, and the wilderness, as we called a tract of
land in which all the wildness of nature was carefully preserved,
lay between the little antique cottage that I was born in and
Greenhurst.</p>

<p class='c014'>Lord Clare had his own rooms in that wing of the building,
and a footpath bordered with wild blossoms, rich ferns, and
creeping ivy, wound from a flight of stone steps that descended
from his apartments, around the circular flower-beds, and
through the wilderness to the jessamine porch of our dwelling.
It was a well-trodden path when I first remember it; and no
foot ever passed down its entire length but that of Lord Clare.
Even the gardeners felt that to be in that portion of the
grounds, after the master left his apartments, was an intrusion.
Turner, dear, good old Turner, visited us every day, but he
always came down the chestnut avenue. No other servant
from the mansion ever came near us.</p>

<p class='c014'>A Spanish woman who had learned but little English, was
all the domestic we had. Lord Clare had brought her from
Malaga, and had she spoken his language well, the most prying
curiosity could have gained no information regarding my parents
from her.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>Our cottage was the loveliest little dwelling on earth. White
roses, rich golden multifloras, and the most fragrant of honeysuckles
covered it to the roof. You were forced to put back a
sheet of blossoms with each hand like drapery every time you
opened a casement. The stone porch was sheeted over and
fringed down with white jessamine: and the garden that surrounded
it was a perfect labyrinth of blossoms. Crimson
fuchias, purple and white petunias, verbenas of every tint, roses
of every clime, heliotrope and carnations made the earth gorgeous,
and the air soft with fragrance.</p>

<p class='c014'>The peaked roof shot up among the branches of a noble elm
tree, and when there was a high wind I loved to watch the old
rook’s nest sway to and fro above the chimney tops, while the
birds wheeled and cowered among the branches like widowers
at a funeral.</p>

<p class='c014'>The interior of the house was like a cabinet. Pictures collected
from abroad, each a gem that might have been piled an
inch deep with gold and its value not yet obtained, hung upon
the walls. Antique cabinets of tortoise-shell and gold, lighted
up with precious stones, stood in the principal room; soft, easy
chairs glowing with crimson velvet; tables of Sèvres china, in
which beds of flowers and masses of fruit glowed, as if just
heaped together by some child that had overburdened its little
arms in the garden; others of that fine mosaic only to be
found in Italy; carpets from Persia, from Turkey, and one
Gobelin, rendered that cottage one nest of elegance. Everything
was in proportion, and selected with the most discriminating
taste. Small as the building was compared to Greenhurst,
it did not seem crowded, yet there was garnered up everything
that Lord Clare held most precious.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was well for us, for he could not have lived away from the
beautiful. His taste, his sensuous enjoyment of material things
might gain new zest by brief contrasts of the hard and the
coarse, but he would not have endured them altogether. Thus
it was often said that no man sustained himself under privation
or the toil of travel better than he did. He not only endured
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>but enjoyed it. The effort sharpened his appetite for the
luxurious and the beautiful. In his whole life, heart and soul,
he was an epicure.</p>

<p class='c014'>Perhaps he had some motive beyond his own convenience in
thus surrounding my mother with objects a queen might have
envied. He might have wished to overwhelm her remembrance
of the miserable gipsy cave in the ravine at Granada by this
superb contrast, or possibly it was only a caprice, a natural
desire to surround her and himself with things that enrich the
intellect and charm the sense. My mother thought it a proof
of affection, but she was a child. We often heap material
benefits on the being who has a right to our devotion as an
atonement for the deeper feeling which the heart cannot render.
The man who truly loves requires no stimulant from without.
He is always surrounded by the beautiful.</p>

<p class='c014'>Another might have feared that this sudden change of condition
would have set awkwardly on a creature so untutored as
my mother—for remember she was a mere child, not more than
sixteen when I was born—but genius adapts itself to everything;
and if ever a woman of genius lived, that woman was
the gipsy wife of Lord Clare. His wife, I say—his wife!—his
wife! I will repeat it while I have breath; she was his wife.
What had the laws of England to do with a contract made in
Spain? What—but I will not go on. My blood burns—the
wild Rommany blood of my mother—it has turned his blood
into fire that smoulders, but will not consume. There are
times when I hate myself for the English half of life that he
gave me. Yet I cannot think of him, so kind, so gentle, so full
of intellectual refinement, without a glow of admiration. It is
his people—his nation—his laws that I hate, not him—not his
memory. Indeed, at times, I feel the tears crowd into my
eyes when I think of him. My hate is a bitter abstraction
after all. When I reflect, it glides from him like rain from the
plumage of an eagle.</p>

<p class='c014'>You should have seen my mother in that beautiful home
back of the wilderness at Greenhurst. The moist climate of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>England refreshed her beauty like dew; her lithe figure had
become rounded into that graceful fullness which we find in
the antique statues of Greece, still the elasticity, the wild
freedom remained. She was more gentle, more quiet, almost
sleepily tranquil, because the fullness of her content arose from
perfect love and perfect trust. She had left nothing in Spain
to regret; and every hope that she held in existence was
centred at Greenhurst. Never did there exist a creature so
isolated. She had no being, no thought, save in her husband.
In the wide, wide world he was her only friend, her sole acquaintance
even.</p>

<p class='c014'>I do not think that she left the park once during her whole
stay in England. The noble little Arabian that she rode knew
every avenue and footpath in the enclosure, but never went
beyond it. She did not seem to feel that there was a world
outside the shadow of those old trees. She felt not the thralls
of society, nor cared for its mandates more than she had done
in the barranco at Granada; but a delicious and broad sense
of freedom—an outgushing of her better nature made this, her
new existence, perfect heaven compared to that.</p>

<p class='c014'>With time her intellect had started into vigorous life. A
teacher so beloved, with perceptions quick as lightning, had
kindled up the rich ore of her nature, and you could see the
flash of awakened genius in every change of her countenance.
Still the world remained a dream to her; she never thought
of human beings except as they were presented to her in books—and
Lord Clare selected every volume that she read. He
was not likely to present knowledge of conventional life to
a person situated as she was, with a mind so acute and imaginative.
No, it was the lore of past ages that she studied.
Those noble old authors of Greece and Rome whom Clare
understood so well, became familiar to her as his own voice.
Without having the least idea of it, she was deeply imbued
not only with classical knowledge, but with the lofty feelings
that inspired those ancient authors, who seldom find themselves
echoed with full tone in the mind of woman.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>Think what a character hers must have been, with all this
grand poetry grafted into the wild gipsy nature.</p>

<p class='c014'>Still my mother was not perfectly happy; a vague want
haunted even her tranquil and luxurious existence. It was
a feeling, not a thought, the shadowy longing of a heart loving
to the centre, which finds half the soul that should have
answered it clothed in mystery. She could not account for this
hungry feeling. It was not suspicion—it was not a doubt,
but something deeper and intangible. The love which fills
a bosom like hers always flings its own shadow, for love is
the sunshine of genius, and shadows ever follow the pathway
of the sun.</p>

<p class='c014'>Still, her life was very happy, not the less so, perhaps, for
these wandering heart-mists. My birth had its effect also, for
it seems to me that no woman thoroughly sounds the depths of
her soul till she becomes a mother. I have read her journal
at this period, and every sentence is a rich, wild gush of poetry;
you can almost feel a torrent of blissful sighs warming the
paper on which she wrote, such as a mother feels when the
first-born sleeps upon her bosom for the first time.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XVI.<br> <span class='large'>CONCEALMENTS AND SUSPICIONS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>And now I have an existence, I am a human soul growing
like a flower in the warmth of that young bosom, flitting
through the house and haunting my mother’s lap like a bird.
The first memory that I have is like a starbeam, as quick
and vivid. My mother sat in a little room somewhere in
an angle of the building just at sunset. Her hair was down;
the Spanish woman had unbraided the long tresses, and shaken
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>them apart in dark wavy masses. They fell over the crimson
cushions of her chair to the ground. The sash doors were
open into a stone balcony choked up with clematis. The sunset
came through in golden flashes, kindling up those black
waves till they shone with a purple bloom. Her dress was
crimson, of camel’s hair, I think, with a violet tinge, and
flowing down her person in soft folds, that glowed in the light
like pomegranates on the bough. Half over her shoulders and
half upon the chair, was a cashmere shawl of that superb palmleaf
pattern which looks so quiet, but is so richly gorgeous;
a profusion of black lace fell around her arms and neck, contrasting
the golden brown of her complexion. Her eyes—I
never saw such eyes in my life—so large, so radiant, yet
so soft; the lashes were black as jet, and curled upward.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is useless. I can remember, but not describe her, that
peach-like bloom, those soft lips so full, so richly red. I have
no idea where I was at the time, only that I saw her sitting
in that room so much like a picture, and felt that she was
my mother.</p>

<p class='c014'>She was looking into the garden with an expression of
tranquil expectation on her face. I remember watching the
shadows from her eyelashes as they lay so dreamily on her
cheeks, for though she evidently expected some one, it was
not with doubt; she was quiet as the sunbeams that fell
around her, now and then turning her head a little as the
Spanish woman gathered up a fresh handful of her hair, but
still with her half-shut eyes fixed upon the footpath that led
through the wilderness.</p>

<p class='c014'>I sat down upon some cushions that had been left in the balcony,
and watched her through the open sash till the heavy
folds of hair were braided like a coronet over her head, and
her look became a little anxious. Then I too began to gaze
across the intervening flower-beds upon the footpath, as if a
share in the watchfulness belonged to me.</p>

<p class='c014'>At last, as the golden sunset was turning to violet, and one
felt the unseen dew as it fell, I saw, through the purple mist, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>man walking slowly along the footpath. My heart leaped, I
uttered a little shout, and clasping my hands, looked up to my
mother. Her lips were parted, and her eyes flashed like
diamonds.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is the Busne—the Busne,” I said.</p>

<p class='c014'>She took me in her arms, and smothering me with glad
kisses, murmured, “My Busne, mine, mine!”</p>

<p class='c014'>I answered back. “No, no, mine,” holding my hand to her
mouth, and still shouting “mine!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Her beautiful face grew cloudy. My words made her restive:
she would not have her entire right questioned even in
sport by her own child. She placed me upon the cushions, and
turning away entered the room again.</p>

<p class='c014'>My father came across the flower garden with a quicker
pace. He held a light basket in his hand which I saw with a
shout, making a desperate effort to clamber over the old stone
balustrade, which was at least ten feet from the ground. He
held up his hand reprovingly, called for me to go back, and
turning a corner of the house, was in the room with my mother
before I could disentangle my hands and clothes from the multiflora
and clematis vines into which I had plunged.</p>

<p class='c014'>This too was the first time that the person of my father fixed
itself definitely on my remembrance. He stood leaning over
my mother’s chair, holding her head back with a soft pressure
of the hand upon her forehead, and gazing down into her
upturned eyes with a smile that might have been playful, but
for a certain undercurrent of sadness that could not escape the
sharp perception of a child like me. Yet even this added to
the singular beauty of his face, a strange type of beauty that
combined the most delicate physical organization with a high
order of mental strength. His forehead, square and high,
without being absolutely massive, was white as an infant’s, and
in moments of rest as smooth. But a painful thought or a
disturbing event would ripple over its delicate surface like the
wind over a snow-drift. The brows grew heavy; two faint
lines marked themselves lengthwise upon the forehead just
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>between the eyes; a peculiarity that I have never seen save in
persons of high talent. The contrast between him and my
mother was almost startling, he, so fair, so refined, so slender,
with a reservation as if he concealed half; she, dark, vivid,
resplendent, with every impulse sparkling in her eye before it
reached the lip; wild as a bird—uncalculating as a child, but
with passion and energy that matched his. When two such
spirits move on harmoniously it is heaven, for the great elements
of character are alike in each; but when they clash,
alas! when they clash!</p>

<p class='c014'>I cannot tell what feelings actuated my parents, or if anything
had happened to disturb them, but they grew sad, gazing
into each other’s eyes, till with a faint smile he dropped
his hand from her head, saying, “am I late, Aurora!”</p>

<p class='c014'>She answered him, and rising with a bright smile, drew the
shawl around her. He sat down in her chair, and she sunk
noiselessly as a woman of the Orient down to the cushions.</p>

<p class='c014'>I was completely overlooked, but if they were forgetful, I
was not. The little basket stood upon the floor, where my
father had placed it. I crept that way softly, took up a layer of
fragrant blossoms, and there, interspersed with vine leaves, I discovered
some of the most delicious hothouse grapes, purple and
amber-hued, with peaches that seemed to have been bathed in
the sunset.</p>

<p class='c014'>In my delight, I uttered an exclamation. My father looked
round.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Come hither, mischief,” he said, threatening me with his
finger! “Come hither with the fruit. It is for your mother.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She half started from her cushion, and held out both hands,
as I came tottering across the carpet, with the basket in my
arms. It was for her, and he brought it. That was enough to
render anything precious; besides the fruit was very fine, and
the hothouses at Greenhurst had produced none that season.
Her eyes sparkled as she received the basket in her lap.</p>

<p class='c014'>“There,” she said, filling my greedy hands with a peach
and a bunch of grapes; “go away, little ungrateful, to forget
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>papa’s kiss in searching after plunder—sit down and be
quiet.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I sat down, and while devouring my fruit, watched and
listened as children will.</p>

<p class='c014'>“How beautifully they are arranged!” said my mother, placing
and replacing the peaches with her hand, for she had the
eye and taste of an artist; “how rich, all the exquisite delicacy
of spring blossoms with a fruity ripeness! One can
almost taste the fragrance in a peach; at least, I fancy so.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Your fancy would almost create a reality!” said my father,
smiling.</p>

<p class='c014'>“How beautiful, how kind in you to devote so much time
and so much taste all for us!” continued my mother, lifting her
radiant eyes to his; “for I know who did all this, not the old
gardener, nor dear good Turner, they could never have blended
these leaves.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Nay, nay,” answered Lord Clare, over whose lips a mischievous
smile had been playing, “do not fling away so much
thankfulness; neither the gardener, Turner, or myself had anything
to do with it. The fruit came from some kind neighbor,
I fancy, who wishes to break my gardener’s heart, for not a
peach or grape has ripened as yet under his supervision. I
found the basket on a table in my room, and as it was prettily
arranged, and looked deliciously ripe, I saved it for you and
the child.”</p>

<p class='c014'>A shade came over the superb eyes of my mother, but she
smiled and murmured, “Very well, you brought them, that is
real at least.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, yes, I brought them sure enough,” he answered,
laughing, as he watched me crowding one grape after another
into my mouth, while I devoured the rest with my eyes.
“See, it is one of Murillo’s children eating grapes. You remember
the picture in Munich?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, oh, it is very like! What eyes the creature has!
How greedily she eats, she is the picture itself!” and my mother
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>laughed also, the last thoroughly gleeful laugh that I ever
heard from her lips.</p>

<p class='c014'>I did not trouble myself about the Murillo, but the fruit was
delicious, that was quite enough for me, so I shook my head
and would have laughed too had that been possible with so
many grapes in my mouth.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Ah, what is this?” exclaimed my mother, holding up a
rose-colored note which she had found among the cape jessamines
that lay in a wreath between the basket and the fruit.</p>

<p class='c014'>“This will explain who has sent the gift, I fancy,” answered
my father, taking the note; “I searched for something of the
kind at first, but could find nothing.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He unfolded the paper carelessly as he spoke. She was
looking up, and I had stopped eating, curious to know all
about it. I shall never forget the change that came over my
father as the writing struck his eye. His face, even to the
lips, whitened. He felt her gaze upon him, and crushed the
note in his hand, while flashes of red came and went across his
forehead.</p>

<p class='c014'>She turned pale as death, and without asking a question
stood up, swaying as if a current of air swept over her. Some
magnetic influence must have linked us three together. Surely
the pulses in my father’s heart reached some string in ours by
those subtle affinities that no wisdom has yet explained. I felt
a chill creeping over me; the fruit lay neglected in my lap, I
cast it aside upon the carpet, and creeping to my mother, clung
to her hand, hiding myself in the folds of her robe.</p>

<p class='c014'>My father still held the note, gazing upon it in silence, buried
in thought. His face had regained its pallid composure; he
seemed to have forgotten our presence. At length he looked
up, but not at us, and with a forced smile broke the seal. He
glanced at the contents, then held it toward my mother with
the same constrained air and smile; but his hand shook, and
even I could see that something very painful had come over
him.</p>

<p class='c014'>“From Marston Court.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>This, with a date, was all the note contained. She read it
over and over again. It explained nothing. It was but a
single sentence, the name of a place of which she had never
heard, but she looked in his face and remained pale as before.
The intuition of a heart like hers is stronger than reason.</p>

<p class='c014'>A constraint fell upon us. I crept away among my cushions,
and felt the twilight darken around us. Then I sunk into a
heavy-hearted sleep, for my parents were both silent, and I was
soon forgotten.</p>

<p class='c014'>When I awoke the windows were still open, and the room
seemed empty. The moonbeams lay white and full upon the
clematis vines, and their blossoms stirred beneath them like
masses of snow. Children always turn to the light. Darkness
seems unnatural to them. I crept out into the balcony, and
clambering up the old balustrade, looked out on the garden.
Close by the wilderness where the shadows lay deepest, I saw a
man walking to and fro like a ghost. Once he came out into
the moonlight, and I knew that it was my father.</p>

<p class='c014'>A narrow flight of steps, choked up with creeping vines, ran
down from the balcony. I scrambled over them on my hands
and knees, tearing my way through the clematis like a wild
animal, and leaving great fragments of my dress behind. I ran
through the flower-beds, trampling down their sweet growth,
and pausing on the verge of the shadow—for I was afraid of
the dark—called out.</p>

<p class='c014'>My father came up hurriedly with an exclamation of surprise,
and evidently alarmed. His hat was off—his beautiful brown
hair, damp and heavy with night dew—but his hands were
hot as he lifted me up, and when I clung to his neck and
laid my cheek to his, it was like fire. Moonlight gives almost
supernatural brilliancy to the human eye. His glittered like
stars.</p>

<p class='c014'>“My child, my poor child,” he said, “what is the matter?
How came you abroad? Your little feet are wet with dew,
wet, clothes and all; what has come over us, my pet, my darling?”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>He took out his watch and looked at it in the moonlight. It
was twelve o’clock. Holding me close to his bosom, he strode
across the garden and up the steps, crushing the vines beneath
his feet. There was no light in the chamber, but upon the
cushion which she had occupied at his feet sat my mother. The
moon had mounted higher, and its light fell like a great silver
flag through the casement. She sat in the centre motionless
and drooping like a Magdalene, with light streaming over her
from the background, as we sometimes, but rarely, see in a picture.</p>

<p class='c014'>At the noise of my father’s footstep, she started up, and
came forth with a wild, wondering look.</p>

<p class='c014'>“How is this, Aurora?” he said, in a voice of mild reproof,
“I left you with the child hours ago, and now when I thought
you both at rest, she is wandering away in the night, wet
through and shivering with cold.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I did not know it. When you went out a strange numbness
fell upon me. It seemed as if I were in the caves at Granada
again, and that all our people were preparing to take me
to the Valley of Stones, I was so passive, so still!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Aurora!” said my father, in a tone of bitter reproof, “you
know how I loathe that subject—never mention it again—never
think of it!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I never have thought of it till to-night,” she answered,
abstractedly, “why should I?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And why to-night?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I do not know. My life has two sides, one all blackness,”
here she shuddered—“the other all light; the barranca at
Granada, and this house, my grandmother and you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Her face became radiant with affection, as she lifted it to his
in the moonlight.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why should she come between us even in my thought?
You are here, you, my child, my home. What has cast this
heavy burden on my soul? It is the gipsy blood beginning to
burn again: surely nothing has happened.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She questioned him closely with her eyes, thus pleading with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>him to silence the vague doubts that haunted her; he answered
faintly,
“Nothing, child, nothing has happened.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She drew a deep breath, and gave forth a faint laugh.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Ah, how strangely I have felt. It must have been the
cold night air. This England is so chilly, and you, how damp
your clothes seem. Your hair is saturated! Come in, beloved,
come in, my poor child, my bird of Paradise, she will
perish!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Lord Clare bore me into the chamber. Lights were obtained,
and my wet garments were exchanged for a night robe of delicate
linen.</p>

<p class='c014'>“See if I do not take care of her,” said my mother, folding
the cashmere shawl around me, while great tears crowded to
her eyes, and she looked timidly into his face.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I do not doubt it,” he answered, kindly, “she is warm now
and getting drowsy upon your bosom. Go to rest; both need
it. Do you know it is after midnight?”</p>

<p class='c014'>He touched her forehead with his lips, and kissing me, prepared
to go. She looked after him, and her great eyes said a
thousand times more than she would have dared to speak.</p>

<p class='c014'>He hesitated, said something about the necessity of being
early at Greenhurst, and then, as if restraint had become irksome
beyond endurance, laid his hand on the stone balustrade,
and leaped over.</p>

<p class='c014'>My mother drew me closer and closer to her bosom, as his
footsteps died on the still air. I remember no more, only that
in the morning I awoke in her arms with the shawl folded
around me. She had not been in bed all night.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>After this night I never remember to have seen that rich,
fruity smile upon my mother’s lips again. Bear in mind, there
had been no quarrel between her and Lord Clare; not even a
hard word; but she loved him so deeply, so fatally. She who
had no world, no thought, no existence that did not partake of
him, and her trust in him had been like the faith of a devotee.
All at once she <em>felt</em> that he had secrets, thoughts, memories,
many things long buried in his heart, of which she had no
knowledge. She had gathered it only from a look; but if all
the angels of heaven had written it out in fire before her eyes,
the revelation could not have been more perfect.</p>

<p class='c014'>And now the proud tranquillity of her life, the rich contentment
of her love departed forever. The gipsy blood fired up
again; she was restless as a wild bird. Her care of me
relaxed. I ran about the park recklessly, like the deer that
inhabited it. She rode out sometimes alone, and always at full
speed. I saw her often talking with old Turner, and observed
that he looked anxious and distressed after their conversations.</p>

<p class='c014'>She was a proud creature, that young gipsy mother, but it
was a pride of the soul, that which blends with genius as platina
strengthens and beautifies gold. All the sweet trusting
fondness of manner which had made her love so luxurious and
dreamy, changed to gentle sadness. She met Lord Clare
meekly and with a certain degree of grateful submission, but
without warmth. It was the humility which springs from
excess of pride. In the whole range of human feelings there
is not a sensation that approaches so near to meekness, as the
pride of a woman who feels a wrong but gives it no utterance.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>Lord Clare saw and understood this. You could see it in his
air; in his slow step as he approached the house; in the anxious
look with which he always regarded my mother on their
first meetings. He grew more tender, more solicitous to divine
her wishes, but never asked an explanation of the change that
had come over her. What was the reason of this? Why did
Lord Clare remain silent on a subject that filled both their
thoughts? Those who know the human heart well can best
answer.</p>

<p class='c014'>Lord Clare had reached that point in life when we shrink
from new sources of excitement. I have said that he was
young only in years. The romance of suffering had long since
passed away. He was capable of feeling the pain, nothing
more.</p>

<p class='c014'>Close by Lord Clare’s estate, and visible through the trees in
winter, when no foliage intervened, was an old mansion that
had once been castellated, but modern art had transformed it
into a noble dwelling, leaving the old keep and some prominent
towers merely for their picturesque effect. A large estate surrounded
it, sweeping down, on the north, to that of Lord
Clare’s, and extending as far as the eye could reach toward the
mountain ridges that terminated the view.</p>

<p class='c014'>The estate had belonged to a wealthy banker of London, one
of those city men who sometimes, by their energies, sweep the
possessions of the peerage into their coffers with a sort of
ruthless magic. This man had married a distant relative of
Lord Clare—a lady who at one time had been an inmate of his
father’s family. She had married the banker suddenly, most
people supposed for his wealth, for she carried nothing but high
birth and connections to her city bridegroom.</p>

<p class='c014'>The dwelling, of which I speak, had been purchased before
the marriage, as a surprise for the lady. Close to the estate
of her young relative, almost regal in its splendor, what gift
could be more acceptable to the bride? It was purchased,
renovated, furnished, and settled upon her. On her bridal
morning only she became aware of the fact. Those who witnessed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>the ceremony saw that the bride turned pale, and that
a strange look came into her face as she acknowledged the
magnificent kindness of her bridegroom; but one brief visit was
all that she made to the estate, and it became a matter of
comment that Lord Clare should have started on his foreign
travels the day before the bridal party arrived in the neighborhood.</p>

<p class='c014'>Now Mr. Morton was dead, and about this time his widow,
Lady Jane, came down to live at the castle. Turner informed
us of this, but there was something in his manner that did not
please me. His precise language, and that sort of solemn
drollery that made him so unique, and to us so lovable, abandoned
him as he told this news. His dear, honest, eyes
wavered, and there was something wrong in his whole appearance
that I shall never forget.</p>

<p class='c014'>Another piece of news he brought us after this. Lord Clare’s
sister, a lady some years older than himself, had arrived at
Greenhurst, and more company was expected. This lady was
a widow, and heiress at law to the title and entailed estates,
for both descended alike to male or female heir. My poor
mother knew nothing of all this; how should she? The laws,
and even customs of England were a sealed book to her. She
only felt that strangers were intruding into her paradise, and
the shadows around her home grew deeper and deeper.</p>

<p class='c014'>I fancy all this gossip was brought to us by Lord Clare’s
direction, for he never mentioned the subject himself, and poor
old Turner certainly did not seem to find much pleasure in imparting
unpleasant information. With all his eccentricities, he
was a discreet and feeling man.</p>

<p class='c014'>I have said that I ran wild about the grounds, like a little
witch or fairy. This made me bold and reckless. I put no
limits to my rambles, but trampled through flower-beds, waded
rivulets, and made myself acquainted with everything I met
without fear. Up to this time I had never entered the mansion
nor met any of the servants without avoiding them.
Perhaps I had been directed to do this. I cannot remember if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>it was the command of my mother or an intuition. But now I
ventured into the garden, the graperies, and at length into the
house itself.</p>

<p class='c014'>I had not seen Lord Clare in several days, and possibly it
was a longing for his presence that gave me courage to steal up
the broad, oaken staircase, and along the sumptuous rooms
that lay beyond.</p>

<p class='c014'>The magnificence did not astonish me, for it was only on a
broader scale than the exquisite arrangement of my own pretty
home; but the stillness, the vast breadth and depth of the
apartments filled me with a sort of awe, and I crept on, half
afraid, half curious, to see what would come next.</p>

<p class='c014'>At length I found myself in a little cabinet. The walls
were hung with small pictures; the carpet was like wood-moss
gleaming through flowers; two or three crimson easy chairs
stood around. On a table lay some curious books in bindings
of discolored vellum, others glowing with purple and gold, the
ancient and modern in strong contrast. An escritoir of ebony,
sculptured an inch deep, and set with precious stones, stood
near it; some papers lay upon the open leaf, and a small drawer
was half out, in which were other papers, folded and emitting
a faint perfume.</p>

<p class='c014'>Child-like, I clambered up the chair that stood before this
desk and began tossing the papers about. Something flashed
up from the drawer like a ray of light. I plunged my hand
in again and drew forth a golden shell, frosted over with ridges
of orient pearls and edged with diamonds. I clasped the gem
between my hands and sprang down with a glad little shout,
resolved to examine it at my leisure. Either the leap or the
pressure of my hands opened the spring, and when I sat down
on the carpet and unclosed my fingers, the shell flew open, and
I saw the face of Lord Clare. I had not seen my father in
some days, and as if the portrait had been himself, I fell to kissing
it, murmuring over the endearing names that his presence
always prompted.</p>

<p class='c014'>After a little, my eyes fell on the opposite half of the shell,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>and the face that met my gaze checked my joy; it was not
beautiful, but a singular fascination hung about the broad forehead
and the clear, greyish blue eyes. The power embodied
there enthralled me more than beauty could have done. My
murmurs ceased; my heart stopped its gleeful beating; I
looked on the pair with a sort of terror, yet could not
remove my eyes.</p>

<p class='c014'>All at once I heard steps in the next room. Huddling the
miniature up with the folds of my scarlet dress, I sat upon the
floor, breathless and full of wild curiosity, but not afraid. The
door opened and Lord Clare came in. He did not observe me,
for a cloud of lace from one of the windows fell between us,
and he sat down by the desk wearily leaning his forehead in
the palm of one hand. I heard him sigh and observed that he
moved his hand rapidly across his forehead two or three times,
as if to assuage the pain of some harassing thought.</p>

<p class='c014'>Still with the miniature and some folds of my dress huddled
together, I got up, and moving toward the desk clambered
softly up the chair on which he sat. Putting one arm around
his neck, I laid my head close to his cheek and murmured,
after the fashion of my gipsy mother, “Oh, my Busne, my
Busne!”</p>

<p class='c014'>He started violently; my weight drew back the chair, and I
fell heavily to the carpet.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Child, child, how came you here?” cried my father, looking
down upon me, pale as death, and excited beyond anything
I had ever witnessed, “surely, surely, your mother cannot have
brought you—tell me, was it Turner—was it”——</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, no,” I answered, forcing back the tears of pain that
sprung to my eyes, “it was myself, not Turner, not mamma,
only myself—my own self; I came alone; I will go alone—I
and the pretty Busne in my dress. That will not throw me
down—that will not strike my head, and fill my eyes with
sparks of fire. It is the good Busne, mamma and I loved—it
will make her glad again. Let me go out—me and the good
Busne.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>I still lay upon the floor, for the blow against my head made
it reel when I attempted to move; but my hand clung to the
miniature, and a fierce spirit of rage, hitherto unknown, possessed
me. He stooped over me with his old, gentle manner,
and attempted to lift me in his arms, but in my rage I shrunk
away.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You don’t love me—you don’t love mamma,” I cried, fighting
him back with one hand. “She knows it—I know it, and
so does good Turner. You go away one, two, four days, and
all that time she sits this way, looking on the floor.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I struggled to a sitting posture and sunk into the abstracted
manner that had become habitual to my mother. I do not
know what chord of feelings was struck by this position, but
tears crowded into his eyes, and dropping on one knee by my
side, he laid a hand on my head. I sprang up so violently that
the miniature fell to my feet, glittering and open.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Child, gipsy, where did you get this?” he cried, white with
agitation, and seizing my arm. “There!” I answered, stamping
my foot, and pointing with my clenched hand to the desk.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Who told you—how dare you?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No one told me—dare, what is that?” I answered, meeting
his pale anger with fire in my heart and eyes.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Contaminated again by this gipsy gang,” he muttered, gazing
upon the female face. “Jane, Jane, to what degradation
you have driven me.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I listened greedily. The name of that woman was Jane;
how from that hour I hated the sound.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Go!” he said to me, sternly, “go and never enter this
room again. Tell your mother that this mad life must have
an end. You shall not run through the estate like a gip—like
a wild animal.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Every word sunk like a drop of gall into my heart—the bitterness—the
scorn—the angry mention of my mother’s name.
I left the miniature in his hand, and, with my infant teeth
scarcely larger than pearls clenched hard, turned away, burning
with futile wrath. He called me back, but I kept on.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>Again he called, and his voice trembled. It only filled my
little heart with scorn that a man should not hold his anger
more firmly. In order to avoid him, I fled like a deer through
the spacious apartments, ignorant what direction I ought to
take, but determined to run anywhere rather than speak to
him again.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XVIII.<br> <span class='large'>THE LADY OF MARSTON COURT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>I sprang forward like a hunted animal, through ante-rooms,
chambers, halls, and galleries. At last I stood panting and
wild as an uncaged bird, in what seemed a little summer parlor,
opening upon the most blooming nook of a flower garden.
Broad sash windows led to the ground, flooding the room with
cheerful light. If I remember correctly, for nothing but a dizzy
sense of luxurious elegance reached me at the time, the apartment
was filled with rich, old-fashioned furniture, which required
the graceful relief of embroidered cushions, and a lavish supply
of flowers to make it so cheerful as it seemed.</p>

<p class='c014'>All the doors in that house opened without noise, and, though
I rushed in madly enough, the carpets were too thick for any
sound of my tumultuous approach to precede me. A lady sat
in one of the low windows reading. I started and held my
breath—not from fear, that from infancy had been a sentiment
unknown to me—but a terrible sensation, which even now I
can neither explain nor describe, seized upon me. The face of
that woman was the one I had seen, in the miniature. The
same grandeur of forehead, the same eyes—not beautiful in
repose, but full of all the latent elements of beauty. The
same blended strength and sweetness in the mouth and chin
was there.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>She was in deep mourning. A crape bonnet and veil lay on
the sofa by her side, and her golden hair contrasted with the
sweeping sable of her bombazine dress. She was neither handsome
nor young, yet the strange mesmeric influence that surrounded
that woman had a thousand times more power over
those who could feel it, than youth or the most perfect loveliness
of form and features could have secured. Her influence
over me was a sort of enchantment. I held my breath, and
remember feeling a deep sentiment of pity for my mother. I
had no reason for this, and was a mere child in all things, but
the moment my eyes fell on that woman they filled with tears
of compassion for my mother.</p>

<p class='c014'>She was reading and did not know of my presence; but
after a moment Lord Clare came hastily forward in pursuit of
me, and though his footsteps gave forth no sound, and his
movements were less rapid than mine, I could see that she <em>felt</em>
his approach; for her pale cheek grew scarlet, and I saw the
book tremble like a leaf in her hand. He passed me, for I
stood close to the wall, and entered the room before she looked
up. Then their eyes met, and hers, oh, how warmly they
sparkled beneath the drooping lids after that first glance!</p>

<p class='c014'>Lord Clare checked his footsteps, stood a moment irresolute,
then advanced toward her. She rose, and I saw that both
trembled, and their voices were so broken that some murmured
words passed between them which escaped me. The first sentence
that I understood was from the lady.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I thought that your sister had arrived, and drove over,
notwithstanding your uncousinly neglect of my note.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“She is expected every moment,” answered Lord Clare, in a
gentle but firm voice, for his self-possession had returned.</p>

<p class='c014'>He sat down as if forced to do the honors of his house, and
made some cold inquiries after the lady’s health, but without
looking at her. The lady was greatly agitated, I could see
that plainly enough. Her color came and went, and if she
attempted to speak, her lips trembled and uttered no sound.
Her eyes were fixed upon Lord Clare, and, in my whole life, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>have never seen anything so full of the soul’s grandeur as those
eyes while they slowly filled with tears. They had not uttered
a word for some moments, then with a quiver not only of the
lips, but of all her features, she uttered his name.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Clarence.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He looked up shivering like a leaf to the sound, and well he
might, for never did a proud woman’s soul go more eloquently
forth in a single word.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What would you with me, Lady Jane Morton?” he said,
with that measured firmness which often precedes the breaking
down of a man’s stern will.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I would say,” answered Lady Jane, and the tears rolled
one by one down her burning cheeks as she spoke, “I would
say that my pride, my stubbornness has wronged you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It has indeed,” was the still cold reply.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I would—I would speak of my regret.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What can regret avail? Lady, tell me if you have the
power—what can atone for years of wasted youth—affections
trampled to the dust, a life disturbed?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Ah, Clarence.”</p>

<p class='c014'>How strangely the name sounded. I had never heard it in
my life before, and I am sure my poor mother was ignorant
that he was called Clarence. This among the rest he had
hoarded from her.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, Clarence, I feel—I have long felt how cruel, how ungrateful,
how miserably proud I was—but I, I, do you think <em>I</em>
have not suffered?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Lord Clare looked at her suddenly. An expression of painful
surprise came over his pale features.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why should you have suffered?” he questioned, almost
sternly, “because you pitied the man you had scorned?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Because I loved him!” The words seemed wrung from the
very depths of her heart. Her face fell forward, and she
buried its shame in her hands.</p>

<p class='c014'>Lord Clare sprang to his feet. A glow of such joy as I
have never seen on a human face before or since, transfigured
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>him. His eyes absolutely blazed; and a smile, oh, the glory
of that smile poured its sunshine over his features. It lasted
but a moment, the next that beautiful joy went out. Some
sharp memory convulsed his features, and he dropped back in
his seat again. His eyes had fallen upon me.</p>

<p class='c014'>She looked up and only saw the last miserable expression of
his face. A faint groan burst from her lips, and you could see
her noble form shrink with a sense of humiliation.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I know—I know,” she cried, clasping her hands, and
making a strong effort to subdue the anguish of disappointment
that seized upon her—“my cruelty has done its work—even
the poor privileges of friendship cannot be ours.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is too late—too late,” said Lord Clare, turning his eyes
almost fiercely upon my little form where it crouched by the
wall.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Still,” said Lady Jane, with more firmness, “I must not
be condemned as heartless and unprincipled where my motives
were all good, and my judgment only in fault. That which
was self-sacrifice must not rest in your heart as perfidy. I was
proud, unreasonable, but as I live all this was from a solemn
conviction of right. I believed that the love you expressed
for me”——</p>

<p class='c014'>“Expressed!” said Lord Clare, in a tone of bitter reproach.</p>

<p class='c014'>“<em>Felt</em> for me then—for I am satisfied that you did love me
once.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Here Lady Jane’s assumed strength gave way. When we
speak of love as a thing that has been, what woman’s heart is
there which does not swell with regret?</p>

<p class='c014'>“I did love you,” said Lord Clare, turning his eyes away
from the sight of her tears.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And do so no longer?” was the earnest, almost supplicating
reply. How full of soul that woman was—what strange
fascination lay about her!</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is too late—I cannot.” He met the expression of her
eyes, those pleading, wonderful eyes, and added, “I dare
not!”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>She understood him. She felt that her empire in that heart
was there still, though it might be in ruins. Still she struggled
hard to suppress the exhibition of this wild delight, but it
broke through her tears like lightning among rain-drops. It
dimpled her mouth—oh, she <em>was</em> beautiful then! She strove
to conceal this heart-tumult, and kept her eyes upon the floor,
but the lids glowed like rose-leaves, and flashes as if from great
diamonds came through her dark lashes. Yes—yes, she was
beautiful then! One moment of expression like that is worth
a life-time of the symmetrical prettiness which ordinary men
admire in common-place women. With the conviction of his
continued affection Lady Jane recovered much of her composure.
Her manner, unconsciously perhaps to herself, became
gentle, pleading, almost tender. If she wept, smiles brightened
through her tears. Now and then her voice was almost
playful, and once as she lifted her eyes to his, there was a faint
reflection of her mood upon Lord Clare’s face. Alas! my poor
mother!</p>

<p class='c014'>“We may never mention this subject again,” she said, with
sweet meekness, “and now let me say one word in my own
exculpation. We were inmates of the same family—you full
of youth in its first bright vigor—I your elder by some years.
It was a safe companionship—our families never dreamed of
danger. I full of worldly wisdom, strong in the untaxed
strength of a heart that had never truly loved, but fancied
itself tried to the utmost, would have smiled in scorn had
any one predicted that which followed. You loved me notwithstanding
my years, my want of beauty, my poverty, you
loved me—and I loved you—God only knows how completely,
how fatally!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Go on,” said Lord Clare, who listened breathlessly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You,” continued Lady Jane, “brave, noble, generous,
had no dread, no false shame. You would have made me lady
of this mansion, the partaker of your bright young life. You
gloried in the passion that won forgetfulness of all disparity
between us, believing that it would secure happiness to us
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>both. You offered me a hand which the proudest lady of
England would have gloried in accepting. Listen to me,
Clarence, I would at that moment have given up all my after
existence, could I have been your wife one year, certain that
the love you expressed would have endured—that you would
never regret the sacrifice so readily made for me. Still, I
refused you—nay, turned from professions of affection that
were the sweetest, dearest sounds that ever filled my ear.
You were young—I no longer so. You were rich—I a poor
dependent on your father’s bounty. I was a coward, I had
no courage to brave the whispers which would say that,
treacherous to the hospitality of my relative, mercenary, grasping,
I had used my experience to entrap the young heir of
a rich earldom into an unsuitable marriage. I could not endure
that the disparity of our years and my poverty should
become subjects of common gossip.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“How little I cared for that!” said Lord Clare, with a constrained
smile.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I know it—but this very generosity, this self-abnegation
frightened me, I could not believe in its permanency. It seemed
to me more the thanklessness of youth than a stern, settled
purpose. You had forbearance for my maturity, but I, ungrateful
that I was, had no faith in your youth.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Did you deem love a thing of years?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Not now, but then I did! My own feelings shocked and
terrified me; they seemed unnatural, I could not forgive my
heart that they had found lodgment there. So much more
absorbing than anything I had ever known, they seemed like a
hallucination. I distrusted the sweet madness that possessed
me, and by one rash, wicked act, sought to wrench our souls
apart, thinking all the time that your happiness required the
effort. I left your father’s house—I—I placed an unloved man
between you and me. I was mad, wicked. In one month
after, when your father died, and I had not his scorn to dread,
I would have given the world—but no matter what or how I
have suffered—you are avenged—I am punished.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>“Why should we revert to this?” said Lord Clare, gently.
“The past is the past.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I have wounded your pride to save mine,” exclaimed Lady
Jane, and her eyes sparkled with tears again. “It is your
turn now, but if you knew—if you knew all, this bitter humiliation
would be some atonement.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I would not soothe my wounded pride at your expense,
Lady Jane, still I thank you. It is something to know that a
passion which cost me so much was not altogether scorned.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She was about to answer with some eagerness, but the sound
of a carriage sweeping round the broad gravel walk to the
front entrance, interrupted her. They both listened, looking
earnestly at each other. Then she reached forth her hand,
and said, smiling through her tears, “Cousin Clarence, we cannot
be enemies, that is too unnatural”——</p>

<p class='c014'>He wrung her hand with a sort of passion, dropped it, and
rushed from the room. She stood a moment weeping, then her
mouth brightened and curved into a smile, and with a proud
air she swept by me, darkening the sunshine with her long,
black garments. I followed her with my eyes, creeping on my
hands and knees across the threshold that I might see her
again, and be sure it was no fairy play I had witnessed.
Then I sat down on the carpet, buried my face in the embroidery
of my scarlet frock, and began to cry.</p>

<p class='c014'>After a time, I could not tell how long, for my little soul was
overflowing with emotions, I felt a hand laid gently on my
head. I started, shook the long curls back from my face, and
there was my father bending over me. His face was so pale
and stern that I shrunk away, but he lifted me up by the arm,
and grasping my hand till it pained me, led me forth.</p>

<p class='c014'>As we approached the hall, I saw servants passing to and
fro, removing packages, lap-dogs, and cushions from a travelling
carriage at the door. A waiting-maid stood in the entrance,
chatting directions in French and broken English, with a pretty
King Charles held close to her bosom, which was amusing himself
with the pink ribbons of her cap.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>“Where is Tip? Will no one bring up Tip?” cried a voice
from the staircase, and directly I saw a tall, spare woman, with
the faintest pink in her cheeks, and the faintest blue in her
eyes, coming down the steps. She had drawn off her gloves
and untied her travelling bonnet. A few long, flaxen curls
streamed down her shoulders with the purple ribbons, and one
sickly white hand glided down the ebony balustrades.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Bring up Tip, I cannot do anything without Tip,” she
continued to say, leaning forward and reaching out her arms
for the dog, which the maid obediently brought to her.</p>

<p class='c014'>I had a full view of this woman as she mounted the staircase
fondling her dog, and from that moment loathed her from my
soul. It was Lord Clare’s sister.</p>

<p class='c014'>My father paused and drew me suddenly back as his sister
appeared on the stairs. The moment she was gone we moved
rapidly through the hall, took a back entrance, and entered the
grounds. He walked on with long, stern strides, clasping my
hand, but unconscious that I was almost leaping to hold my
pace even with his. We entered the wilderness, and then, for
the first time, my father spoke.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Zana,” he said, “look at me here, in my eyes.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I lifted my gaze to his steadily. His eyes were inflamed
and full of trouble; they fell before mine, and left my little
heart burning with strange triumph.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Zana, you saw the lady?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And heard all that she was saying?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What was she talking about? Can you tell me?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I can tell you what she said, and what you answered.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Word for word?” questioned my father, anxiously.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, sir, word for word.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And you will repeat this to—to your mother?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, I will not.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Indeed,” said Lord Clare, and I saw that his eye brightened
with a look of relief, “and why not?”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>“Because I will not. She would hate that dark lady as I
do—she would cry more and more—she would know all about
it!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“About what?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“About”—I hesitated, no words came to express the ideas
that were fixed upon my mind so firmly. I knew as well as he
did that he loved that lady, and that my mother was a burden,
but how could the infant words at my command express all
this? My father seemed relieved by my hesitation, and said
more gently,</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, well, go home, tell your mother that I have company—my
sister, you will remember—and that I may not be
able to see her this evening.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“She can wait!” I answered, swelling with indignation.</p>

<p class='c014'>He led me to the verge of our garden, pointed along the path
I should take, and turned back without kissing me. I was
glad of this, though he had never done it before. My little
soul was up in arms against him.</p>

<p class='c014'>I did not go home, but wandered about the wilderness
searching for birds’ nests, not because I enjoyed it, but a dread
of seeing my mother for the first time kept me in the woods.</p>

<p class='c014'>Her life was more quiet than ever after this, but you would
not have known her for the same being. Her eyes grew larger
and <em>so</em> wild; her figure became lithe and tall again; all the
luxuriance of her beauty fled. She suffered greatly, even a
child could see that.</p>

<p class='c014'>Greenhurst was filled with company, and we seldom saw
Lord Clare. Turner came to us every day, but he too seemed
changed. The rich, dry humor so long a part of his nature
forsook him. His visits were short, and he said little. Thus
the season wore on, and I suffered with the rest. How many
hours did I remain at the foot of some great oak or chestnut,
thinking of that proud lady and her interview with my father.
I kept my secret; not once had I alluded to that strange visit
to the hall. It weighed upon me—at times almost choked me,
but I felt that it must remain my own burden.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XIX.<br> <span class='large'>MY FIRST HEART TEMPEST.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>I had never seen a hunt in my life, for though Lord Clare
kept horses and hounds, they had never been called out since
our residence at Greenhurst. But now, we often heard the
sweep of horses and the baying of dogs from the distant hills.</p>

<p class='c014'>One day, I wandered off lured by this novel sound, and lost
myself in a pretty valley. I am not sure if it was not beyond
the verge of our park, for I exhausted myself with the fatigue
of running after the sound, and fell breathless upon the moss
beneath a clump of trees. While I lay bewildered and panting
with fatigue, a group of horsemen rushed down the valley in
full chase. Their red coats flashed between the leaves, and I
saw hound after hound leaping through the brushwood. They
disappeared like a flash of lightning. Then came the swift leap
of other horses, and a lady appeared among the trees. Her
hunter was on the full run, shooting like a thunderbolt through
thickets, and over the broken ground with foam flashing from
his nostrils, and blood dropping from his mouth where the curb
had been ground into it. The lady had lost all control of her
hunter. She reeled in the saddle, and nothing but her desperate
hold upon the rein kept her from falling.</p>

<p class='c014'>I knew her, notwithstanding the masculine hat and cravat,
the black skirt sweeping behind her like a thunder-cloud, and
the deathly paleness of her face. I knew her the first moment,
and shrunk back into the undergrowth, not with fear but loathing.
Oh, how I did hate that woman. Some persons think
children cannot hate. They never studied a child like me.
She came on, pale as marble, reeling with exhaustion, but with
a strong will firing her eyes till they gleamed like stars beneath
her hat. On she came. The horse veered. A ravine lay
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>before him. He stretched out his limbs and plunged forward.
She saw death in the next instant, shrieked, flung up her arms,
and the horse leaped from under her, lost his foothold on the
opposite bank, reeled backward and fell with a fearful neigh
into the depths of the ravine.</p>

<p class='c014'>I did not move but looked on waiting to see if she would
stir. I had no idea of death, but as I saw her pale face turned
to the sky, her black garments sweeping like a pall down the
bank, and her lifeless hand lying so still in the grass, a fierce
interest seized me. It was not joy, nor pity, nor hate, but I
thought of my mother, and hoped that the stillness would last
forever.</p>

<p class='c014'>A second horse came tearing his way down the valley. A
scarlet coat flashed before my eyes and made me dizzy. Some
one dismounted, a horse stood panting beneath his empty saddle.
The fiery glow of crimson mingled confusedly with those
black garments on the grass—then my sight cleared, and there
was my father holding that woman in his arms—pressing her
frantically to his bosom—raining kisses upon her marble forehead
and her white eyelids. He held her back with his arms,
looked into her face, uttered wild, sweet words that made my
heart burn. Tears flashed down his cheeks, and fell like great
diamonds in the blackness of her dress. His grief made him
more of a child than I was.</p>

<p class='c014'>He strained her to his heart, pressed his lips to hers, as if
his own soul were pouring itself into her bosom.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Jane, Jane, my love, my angel, my wife, listen to me, open
your eyes! you are not dead—not gone—lost without knowing
how much I love you. Oh, open those eyes—draw one breath,
and I am your slave forever.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She did not move, but lay cold and still in his arms. I was
glad of it!</p>

<p class='c014'>He laid her upon the grass with a groan that made even me
start, and looked despairingly around.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Will no one come?—must she die?—oh, my God, what can
I do?”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>He stood a moment, mute and still, looking, oh, how steadily,
how mournfully down upon her. Then speaking aloud, and
with a solemnity that made me tremble, he said,</p>

<p class='c014'>“I have avoided her—struggled, suffered, tried to crush the
great love that is within me, and this is the end! What is left
to me?”</p>

<p class='c014'>I saw a shudder pass over him, and knew that he was thinking
of us—me and my mother.</p>

<p class='c014'>Again his voice reached me, not loud, but deep and solemnly
impressive. His mournful eyes were bent upon her, and he
slowly sunk to her side.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Let her live—only live,” he said, “and so help me heaven,
her own will shall dispose of me! Let all else perish, so she
but breathe again!”</p>

<p class='c014'>I rose from the ground and stood before him. My little
hand was clenched, and my frame shook with passion seldom
known to one of my tender years.</p>

<p class='c014'>He started, as if a serpent had sprung up from the bosom of
that beloved one, gazed in my eyes an instant, and then put me
sternly back with his hand.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Go,” he said, with a sharp breath, as if every word were a
pain—“go, weird child, I ask not what evil thing brings you to
search my soul with those unnatural eyes—but go and tell your
mother all that you can understand of this. Tell her that if
this lady lives, she will be my wife—if not, I leave England
forever. Tell her all!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I will tell her!” I said, looking fiercely into his eyes. “You
shall never see her again, never, never, never!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Such passion must have been fearful in a little child. He
looked on me with a sort of terror.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Tell your mother I will write, and send Turner to her,” he
said, more gently.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I will say that you hate her and love this one!” was my
fierce reply, “That is enough!—she will drop down like stone,
as this one has!”</p>

<p class='c014'>My eyes fell upon Lady Jane as I spoke. Her broad eyelids
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>quivered, and a faint motion disturbed the deathly white of her
lips. These signs of life filled me with rage. I saw the breath
struggling to free itself, and, lifting my tiny foot, dashed it down
upon her bosom, looking into her face like an infant fiend to see
if I had trampled the coming life away. Her eyes slowly
opened, as if it were to the pressure of my foot, and then I
flew reeling back against the bank—<em>my father had struck me</em>.</p>

<p class='c014'>I rose and went away, but without shedding a tear—without
looking back. I have been told that my face was very pale
when I reached home, but that I was smiling steadily till the
teeth gleamed between my lips.</p>

<p class='c014'>When I reached home, my mother was in the little room that
I have described, lying upon a couch, with her large, sleepless
eyes wide open, and gazing upon the window.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Get up, mother,” I said, seizing the cashmere shawl that
lay over her, and casting it in a gorgeous heap on the floor—“get
up; I want to tell you something.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She rose with a wild look, for my voice was sharp, and my
face so strangely unnatural that it had the force of command.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Come out into the garden—into the woods, mother.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She followed me passively. I led her down the balcony
steps, across the flower-beds, and into the wilderness. It was
gloomy there. Shadows lay thick among the trees, and a
leaden sky bent overhead. I liked it. In the broad sunshine
I could not have told her. The anguish in her face frightened
me even as it was.</p>

<p class='c014'>She heard me through without uttering a word, but the
gleam of her eyes and the whiteness of her face was more
heart-rending than the wildest complaints. She held my hand
all the time, and as I told her of the scene I had just witnessed,
of his caresses, of the blow, her grip on my fingers became like
a vice. But I did not wince, her own gipsy blood was burning
hot in my veins.</p>

<p class='c014'>I did not sleep that night, but lay upon the carpet in my
mother’s room, resolved not to be taken away till she was in
bed.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>Turner was there in the evening, and they conversed together
alone, for more than an hour. The old man left us, with tears
in his eyes. I heard my mother say to him in her low, sad
voice, for she was always sad now,</p>

<p class='c014'>“Do not fail me, my good friend; I shall never ask another
favor of you, so grant me this.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Poh, poh!” was his answer, “you will ask five thousand;
and I shall perform every one, trust old Turner for that!”</p>

<p class='c014'>But there were tears in the old man’s voice, I was sure of
that. After his departure my mother was greatly disturbed,
walking the room, wringing her hands, and convulsed with the
tearless grief that rends one’s heart-strings so silently.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XX.<br> <span class='large'>MY MOTHER’S LAST APPEAL.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>When it drew toward midnight, and she saw me, to all
appearance, sleeping tranquilly on the floor, I heard a movement
in the room as if my mother were preparing to go out.
I opened my eyes and watched.</p>

<p class='c014'>She took up the cashmere shawl and folded it over her head
and person, leaving only the face exposed, after the fashion of
a Spanish mantilla. Her face looked thin, but very beautiful,
surrounded by those gorgeous colors, for her cheeks were of a
burning scarlet; and her eyes—in my life I have never seen an
expression like theirs. It was like the reflection of a star
in deep waters. She stole out through the balcony. I heard
her descend to the garden, and followed, actuated, I think,
by a vague dread that she was about to leave me forever.</p>

<p class='c014'>She threaded the wilderness with a quick step, and kept her
way through the grounds cut up into thickets and flower-beds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>that lay around Greenhurst. I do not think that she had
ever been there before in her life, but she seemed to find the
way by intuition. I followed close, but unseen, and to my surprise
saw her pass into the hall by the back entrance, through
which Lord Clare had led me. The door was not entirely
closed after her, and I crept through. The hall was dark, but
she moved noiselessly on, gliding like a shadow up the broad
staircase.</p>

<p class='c014'>Now I was guided only by the faint ripple of her garments,
for the upper halls lay in perfect darkness, and she was more in
advance.</p>

<p class='c014'>I saw by the glow of light that came into the darkness, that
a door had been softly opened, in which a lamp was burning,
and moved along the wall till I stood in view of a bed-chamber
lighted as with moonbeams, for a lamp had been placed within
an alabaster vase, evidently for this subduing purpose. I saw
nothing distinctly in the room, but have a vague remembrance
of a cloud of azure silk and rich lace brooding in one corner of
the chamber—a couch underneath, white as mountain snow,
and on it <em>that woman</em>, asleep, and my mother gazing upon her.</p>

<p class='c014'>The sleeper scarcely seemed to breathe. A narcotic influence
was evidently upon her, which had been used to still some previous
pain; but all traces of anguish had departed from her
forehead, from which the bright hair was swept back, giving
its broad, massive grandeur to the light. A halo of happiness
lay upon her face that made your breath come quick; the
wealth of a great soul seemed breaking over her noble features
as she slept. The eyes underneath those broad lids were swimming
in joy, that broke through like perfume from the white
leaves of a rose. The atmosphere which hung about her
seemed warm and fragrant, like that of an Indian summer in
North America.</p>

<p class='c014'>There stood her contrast, my gipsy mother, with the hot
blood of her race burning in her eyes, her forehead, and that
now firm mouth. I looked in her face, and thought she was
about to spring upon her prey, for the passions burning there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>grew fierce as death. She bent down and scrutinized the
sleeper, then felt in her hair, and looked sharply around the
room, I thought for some weapon.</p>

<p class='c014'>“My oath, my oath!” she muttered, casting her great eyes
around, “nothing but death can separate us; why not <em>her</em>
death?”</p>

<p class='c014'>I sprang forward, wild with terror, and caught hold of her
dress.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mamma, oh, mamma, come away, come away,” I pleaded,
in a whisper.</p>

<p class='c014'>She yielded to me, and walked slowly from the chamber, like
one moving in a dream.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Hush!” she said, as we stood in the hall, “I thought it
had been <em>his</em> room. Where is it, child, you know?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Come away—come away!” I whispered, still keeping a
firm grasp on her dress. “It is dark—I’m afraid.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She broke from me, and I lost her. The faint sound of a
foot reached me once, but I had no courage to follow, and
cowered down in the hall, shivering and noiseless. It seemed to
me that I remained a year in that black stillness. I could endure
it no longer, but groped my way to the staircase out into
the open air.</p>

<p class='c014'>The moon was up, but overwhelmed by an ocean of clouds.
Now and then a leaden gleam broke out, and this gave me
courage to wait and watch.</p>

<p class='c014'>She came forth at last, and when I sprang toward her,
caught me firmly by the hand.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Come,” she said, “the oath falls back here—the gipsy
blood will not fail me when it is only us.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What do you mean, mamma? Have you seen him, the
Busne?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Was he awake, mamma?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Awake!” and her laugh was fearful. “Child, do you
think he could sleep?—can ever sleep again?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Did he say anything? Was he sorry for striking me?”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>“Hush!” said my mother, sharply, “he has struck us both,
the body for my child—the heart for me!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Did you strike him back, mother?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, but I will. The stone that crushes me shall fall on his
soul.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Now I recognized my gipsy mother. She turned to me, and
a straggling moonbeam touched her face.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Zana, do you know what an oath is?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, mamma, I heard you mention the word in your sleep,
and so asked Turner.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I have sworn an oath, Zana. Will you help me keep it?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I will help you, mamma.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Let me make you strong with my kisses, Zana, you are no
child.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I clung to her, answering back that wild caress, for my heart
was burning with a sense of her wrongs.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I was a child once, mother, but that has all gone by. I
am something else now; not a woman like you, but sharper,
like a little dagger with bright stones on the hilt, that you
sometimes fasten up your hair with. The handle is so pretty;
but the point, isn’t that sharp?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It was well I left it behind, to-night, Zana.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You could not leave <em>me</em> behind, I <em>would</em> go!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Are you tired, Zana?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Walk fast then, for we must be a long way from this before
morning.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Where are you going, mother?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“To keep my oath!”</p>

<p class='c014'>We entered the cottage for the last time. My mother must
have anticipated what was to happen, for she took me into her
room, tore off my pretty scarlet frock, and replaced it with the
garments of a little boy. Her own dress she changed also, and
we left the house together, both clad in male garments, and
each carrying a little bundle in our hands.</p>

<p class='c014'>Where we went first, I do not know. The events of that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>day and night were burned upon my memory, but after that I
had only a vague idea of travelling day after day—of broad,
stormy seas, a river that ran with waves of dull gold, orange
groves, wild hills, and at last a city in the midst of beautiful
plains, filled with antique houses, and beyond with snow-capped
mountains looming against the sky. The grim towers of a ruin
fixed itself on my memory, frowning between the city and those
mountain-tops, and when I asked my mother of the name of this
city and ruin, she answered briefly, “Granada, the Alhambra,”
nothing more.</p>

<p class='c014'>I was not surprised at this, for since we left Greenhurst, she
had scarcely uttered a longer sentence.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was sunset when we came in sight of Granada. She
paused in a recess of the hills, and opening our bundles, changed
her dress and mine, casting away the male attire. I remember
gazing at her with wonder as she stood before me in her strange
dress. The blue bodice, the short crimson skirt, flowered and
heavy with tarnished gold, the gorgeous kerchief knotted under
her chin, this dress had been the contents of her bundle. Mine
was more simple, a frock of maize-colored stuff broidered with
purple. My feet and ankles were bare to the knees.</p>

<p class='c014'>My mother bent down and kissed me.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Are you a child now, Zana?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, I am what you are.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Come.”</p>

<p class='c014'>We descended into the Vega and passed through Granada
long after dark. I was very tired and faint, but kept up with
my mother, determined to hold firm to my promise. During
our whole journey I had not once complained. We left the
city and entered a deep, gloomy ravine, lighted up by a host
of internal fires, that seemed to burn in the bosom of the hill.
Wending along the dusty road, I saw that all the embankment
was cut up into holes, from which the lights came, and that
these were swarming with human beings.</p>

<p class='c014'>We walked on, speaking to no one, till my mother stopped
before one of these caves of which the door was shut. She
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>paused, and for one instant I felt her tremble, but the emotion
was gone in a breath, and pushing the door open, she
went in.</p>

<p class='c014'>A little old woman sat in one end of the cave, rocking to
and fro on a wooden stool, beneath the beams of a smoky lamp
that stood in a niche over her head. The creature arose as we
entered, passed one skeleton hand over her eyes, and muttered
“who comes—who dares open my door, when I once shut it for
the night?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“One who fears nothing now, not even you, grandame,” said
my mother, advancing firmly up the cave.</p>

<p class='c014'>The old woman kept her hand above those gleaming eyes,
and pored keenly over the haggard face before her.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why have you come back?” she said, fiercely.</p>

<p class='c014'>“To keep my oath, grandame!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Your oath. Is he dead, then? Is it his blood that makes
your face so white!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, he is safe—it may be, happy,” answered my mother,
and for the first time since we left England, I heard her voice
falter. “He repudiates the caloe marriage. He loves another.
I saw her under his roof. He will make her his wife. Grandame,
I have come back to die. It is all of my oath that I can
redeem.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Under his roof? he will marry her. Girl, where was Papita’s
poniard, that you did not strike?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“She looked innocent in her sleep. I could not do it. She
knew nothing of me, of my wrongs, or the vengeance that
threatened her. A word would have stabbed her deeper than
your poniard, grandame, but I could not speak it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You came away, and left her alive?” shrieked the old woman
fiercely.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I could <em>not</em> kill the thing he loved,” answered my mother,
with pale firmness.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You came away, leaving these two traitors to marry and scoff
at the gipsy!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“The lady knows nothing, and cannot scoff at us. He will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>never revile one who could have driven her from his path by
pointing to his child, and saying only, ‘<em>he has been mine!</em>’ but
chose rather to come here and die.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is useless, grandame—these frowns, the locking of those
sharp teeth. The desperate have no fear. I have disgraced
my people, and am ready to redeem my oath.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And what is this?” said Papita, touching me with a loathing
scowl.</p>

<p class='c014'>“My child, and his,” answered my mother, and I felt her
fingers close tight on my hand.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, you did well to bring her. There is yet a drop of the
old blood left; I see it in her face.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The weird creature drew nearer and kissed me. I bore it
without a shudder.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Can it be to-morrow?” said my mother, calmly, as if she
had been speaking of a June festival.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes,” was the savage reply. “The people will not wait,
Chaleco, most of all.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Let him be sent for.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No,” said the Sibyl with a touch of feeling, “he shall not
gloat over your shame more than the rest. Go in yonder—you
have broken one half the oath, for the rest”——</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am ready—I am ready, only let it be soon,” said my
mother—“at daylight.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“In yonder! daylight will soon come,” answered the Sibyl,
pointing to the inner room. “I will go and prepare the
people. They thought you dead. How they will stare when
Papita tells them of her trick. They think her old, worn out,
dull—she who can throw sand in the eyes of a whole tribe.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>Papita went out muttering hoarsely to herself, as we cowered
together in that close hole. A great tumult arose from
without. The tramp of feet, the hooting of voices, and wild
murmurs drew near and nearer. My mother did not tremble,
but when the door flew open, she stood out in the cave, holding
me in her arms. The light from a dozen torches fell redly
over us, a hundred fierce eyes glared in, and the door was
blocked with grim, shaggy human heads, all waving and shaking
in ferocious astonishment.</p>

<p class='c014'>She stood before them, like a dusky statue, her heavy, raven
hair falling in masses down her temples, and her pale hands
locked around me so tightly that I breathed with pain. As
the torchlight fell upon her dress, some one in the crowd
recognized it as the wedding array that had been purchased
for her marriage with Chaleco, and a low howl ran through the
crowd.</p>

<p class='c014'>“She mocks us, she mocks us with her shame—take her
forth at once. It is a long way to the mountains, and by daylight
the authorities may be upon us,” cried a stern voice.</p>

<p class='c014'>“To the mountains—to the mountains!” ran through the
throng, and then one or two from the crowd rushed in and
would have seized my mother. But the old Sibyl placed herself
in their way, confronting them with fierce wrath.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Her father was a count, and her father’s father. It is
of her own free will she comes. Let her walk forth alone.
Think you that the grandchild of Papita is not strong enough
to die?”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>The crowd fell back, forming a wall from each side the door
up the ravine. Through this lane of fierce, human bloodhounds
my mother walked firmly, holding me still in her arms.
By her side went the old Sibyl, regarding the tribe with a look
of keen triumph, exulting in the desperate strength that nerved
their victim. She gazed on the unearthly brilliancy of her
countenance, as the torchlight fell upon it, and cried out with
fierce ecstasy, “see, it is my soul in her eyes—my blood in her
cheeks. Thus would old Papita go forth had she tarnished
the honor of her people.”</p>

<p class='c014'>On we went, crowding upward through the mountain passes
till the snow became thick beneath our feet, and Granada lay
diminished and indistinct in the distance. The dawn found us
in a hollow of the mountains, with snow peaks all around, and
half choking up the little valley. Nothing was seen but rocks
protruding through the virgin snow, and a group of stone
cairns peering through the drifts in the bottom of the valley.
The rosy sunrise broke over the peaks as we entered this
gloomy pass, but it did not penetrate to us. My mother lifted
her eyes to the illuminated snow, a faint quiver ran through
her form, and I felt the arms that supported me tremble. I
threw myself upon her neck, and clung there, weeping. She
shivered in my embrace. I felt her limbs giving way, and
shrieked aloud. She answered me with a long, long kiss, that
froze itself into my heart, for I knew that it was the last.
Then she lifted up her face and said, in a clear, sad voice, “who
will take my child?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Give her to me, Aurora!”</p>

<p class='c014'>The voice was full of compassion, and a wild, haggard man,
in the remnants of what had been a picturesque costume, came
forward with his arms extended. His fierce heart had yielded
at last. There was relenting in his gesture and voice.</p>

<p class='c014'>My mother turned her eyes mournfully upon him.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I have wronged you, Chaleco, but now”—she turned her
eyes steadily toward the cairns, and added, “<em>all</em> will be atoned
for.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>“I want no atonement—I am sick of revenge,” was the impetuous
answer. “Give me your child.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Chaleco, one promise—take her back to England. You
will find plenty of gold sewed up in her dress. I was out of
my mind—mad to bring her here. Take her back; she is
bright beyond her years, and will tell him all better than any
one else. Will you promise this, Chaleco, for the sake of old
times?”</p>

<p class='c014'>She smiled a pale, miserable smile, as she made the request.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Give me your child; I will take her to England!” answered
Chaleco, in a hoarse voice.</p>

<p class='c014'>“That is all,” answered my mother, gently, “I am ready
now.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She turned away her face, and forcing my arms from her
neck, held me toward the gipsy chief.</p>

<p class='c014'>I shrieked, and struggled to get back, but he folded my face
to his bosom, and thus smothering my cries, walked rapidly
away.</p>

<p class='c014'>Notwithstanding the close pressure of his arms, I heard a
shriek, then the sound of dull, heavy blows, as if stone or iron
were falling against some yielding substance. A groan burst
from Chaleco. He shuddered from head to foot, and throwing
himself forward, forced my face down into the snow, and buried
his own there also, moaning and trembling.</p>

<p class='c014'>The blows grew duller, heavier, and a soft, smothered noise
mingled with them. No other sound was in the glen, not
a hum, not a footfall, nothing but these muffled sounds, and
the groans of Chaleco. Then a hush, like that of midnight,
fell over us. Chaleco held his breath, and I struggled no
longer; it seemed as if the cold snow had struck to my heart.</p>

<p class='c014'>At last Chaleco arose, trembling with weakness, and taking
me in his arms again, staggered through the snow down the
glen. The tribe stood in a great circle round a cairn that had
not existed when we entered the “Valley of Stones.” The
stillness appalled me. I broke from Chaleco’s feeble hold, and
rushed forward, calling for my mother.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>The old Sibyl seized me by the arm, pointed to the cairn,
and answered, “She is there!” I looked fearfully upon the stony
pyramid, but saw nothing, till my eyes fell downward to the
snow at its base—it was crimson with blood. Then I knew
what death was, and what her oath meant. I grew sick,
turned, and staggering toward the gipsy chief, fell at his feet.</p>

<p class='c014'>I remember, dimly, being in the cave once more, and seeing
the old Sibyl counting gold into her lap. I remember, also, that
Chaleco was there, and she said to him, pointing to me:</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, she will not die, half the oath only is accomplished, she
must do the rest.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then the cairn, with its reddened base, came before me, and
I fell away again.</p>

<p class='c014'>Months must have been oblivion to me, for my next clear
idea was in England. I lay in a canvas tent pitched by the
wayside, half way between Greenhurst and the neighboring village.
Chaleco and the Sibyl were with me, dressed after the
vagrant fashion of those broken tribes of our people who infest
England. I was in rags, and seated on the ground, wondering
how this change had been made. Chaleco stood by the
entrance of the tent watching; the old woman kept in a
remote corner, and while I pondered over the meaning of it all,
a merry chime of bells swept across the fields, that made my
heart leap. I broke into a laugh, and crept toward the
entrance of the tent, enticed by the sunlight that sparkled on
the sward.</p>

<p class='c014'>I had placed myself at Chaleco’s feet, when the sound of an
advancing cavalcade came from toward the village. Chaleco
shaded his eyes, and I saw them glow like coals beneath his
hand. First came a troop of children with baskets and aprons
full of blossoms, scattering them thick in the highway. Then
followed a carriage, with four black horses, streaming with
rosettes and white ribbon, followed by others decorated after
the same fashion, and filled with richly dressed people. The
children halted, and gathered around the first carriage, tossing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>showers of roses over its occupants. In the midst of this
blooming storm, I saw my father and <em>that woman</em>. The gleam
of her silver brocade, the snowy softness of the bridal veil made
me faint again. The snow drifts in the mountains of Spain,
encrimsoned and trampled, swept before my dizzy senses. As
I saw my father half enveloped by the waves of those glittering
bridal garments, but still pale and looking so anxious, it
seemed to me as if those soft drifts had been shovelled over him
in mockery of my mother’s death.</p>

<p class='c014'>I asked no question, but gathered from my companions, who
conversed in cautious tones, that Lord Clare and his bride would
rest some days at Greenhurst before entering upon their wedding
tour. I had no strength, no spirit then. Instead of
becoming angry, I was faint, and lay down in the tent, weeping
feebly as another child of my years might have done in its
illness.</p>

<p class='c014'>I remember hearing shouts, and seeing flashes of fireworks
that went off in the village that night, and I saw old Papita
and Chaleco hold up a small vial between them and the lamp,
filled with a purple liquid—then, as in a dream, they passed
away from the tent.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was deep in the night, when I started from my sleep.
Papita was shaking me by the shoulder, her face was close to
mine, and it looked like a death’s head.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Awake!” she said, reeling on her feet, as if intoxicated.
“It is over—Papita has kept her oath—the work is done.
Get up, last of my race, and see how a woman of Egypt can
die.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The terrible light of her eyes fired me with strength. I
stood up, and asked what she had done—why she talked of
dying.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I have left the bride stiff and stark on her silken couch up
yonder. A drop of this—only one drop—in the water which
sparkled on her toilet was enough. I stood by her bed when
the bridegroom came—<em>she</em> was smiling on her pillow. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>drao that I distill, always leaves smiles behind it. He saw me,
old Papita, whose blood he has shamed, whose wrath he has
braved, and while he stood frozen into a statue, I glided away,
away, away forever! forever more.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She crooned over these last words in a low mutter, and sunk
slowly down to the earth.</p>

<p class='c014'>Chaleco bent over her.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mother Papita,” he said, “how is this? you have not
drank of the drao!”</p>

<p class='c014'>The old woman gave a cough that rattled in her throat.</p>

<p class='c014'>“There was no need, my count. Did you think the old
frame would not give out when its work was done? I knew it—I
knew it. Come hither child, and take ‘the gipsy’s legacy,’
hate, hate, hate to the Busne, the enemies of our people.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She struggled to a sitting posture, and tore the great ruby
rings from her ears.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Your dagger, Chaleco. Quick, quick,” she said.</p>

<p class='c014'>Chaleco took a poniard from his bosom. The Sibyl seized
it, and thrust the sharp point through each of my ears, then she
locked the rubies into the wounds, while the blood trickled
down their antique settings.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is your mother’s blood that baptizes them, remember.”</p>

<p class='c014'>As the Sibyl spoke she staggered to her feet and pressed her
cold hands upon my forehead, passing them down my face
again and again. At first the touch made me shudder; then a
feeling of dull calm came over me. The excitement left my
nerves, and I lay like one in a trance. The past was all gone,
only a vivid consciousness of the present remained; my eyes
were closed, my limbs still as death, but my senses seized upon
every motion, every whisper, and locked them up in my
memory, creating each instant a new past for that which had
left me.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Now leave her to the destiny that she must surely work
out, Papita’s vow is redeemed.”</p>

<p class='c014'>When the old woman said these words, her voice seemed far
off and unreal as the echoes of some forgotten horror. I heard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>her gasp for breath; moans broke from her lips—a sharp cry,
and her limbs fell together in a heap, like a skeleton when its
wires give way.</p>

<p class='c014'>For a moment all was deathly stillness, Chaleco held his
breath—some brooding evil seemed to fall upon the tent.</p>

<p class='c014'>Still I lay bound in that mesmeric trance, conscious, but
utterly helpless. I heard Chaleco steal forth, and for a long
time the grating of a spade reached me from the depths of a
neighboring hollow. Then came the fall of earth, spadeful
after spadeful, followed by stealthy footsteps coming toward
the tent again.</p>

<p class='c014'>Chaleco came close to me, stooped down and took the
antique rings from my ears. I was numb and could not feel
the pain; but consciousness utterly left me after that. The
iron thread of my mother’s life was woven into mine that terrible,
terrible night.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXII.<br> <span class='large'>LOST MEMORIES.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>I found myself lying in a gipsy’s tent perfectly alone, dizzy,
feverish, and so parched with thirst that it seemed to me one
drop of water would satisfy every want I could ever have again.
An earthen pitcher stood near the fresh hay on which I was
lying. I reached forth my feeble hand and slanted it down, till
the bottom glistened on my sight. Then I fell back weeping.
It was empty, not a drop—not a drop! How terrible was that
thirst. I felt the tears rushing down my cheek, and strove to
gather them in my hand, thinking, poor thing, to moisten my
burning lips with the drops of my own sorrow. The wind blew
aside the fall of canvas that concealed the entrance to my tent,
and I saw through it a glimpse of the bright morning; clover
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>fields bathed in fragrant mist; soft, green meadow grasses
sparkling with dew. Then the whole strength of my being
centered in one great wish—water! My wild eyes were turned
in every direction where the soft drops seemed flashing, dancing,
leaping around me like a whirlwind of diamonds. I closed my
eyes and strove to shake the hallucination from my brain. A
moment’s rest, and there was another calm glimpse of the dewy
morning. I wonder if Paradise ever looks half so beautiful to
the angels.</p>

<p class='c014'>Dizzy and fascinated, I crept across the tent on my hands
and knees, dragging the loose hay after me, and moaning softly
with each strain upon my shrinking muscles, till I crept into
the deep verdure. How softly the cool dew-drops rained over
me as I lay down at length in the soft meadow grass. My face,
my arms, and my little, burning feet were bathed as with new
life. I lay still, and laughed with a glee that frightened up a
lark from her nest close by. The young ones began to flutter,
and piped forth their tiny music as if to comfort the lone child
that had stolen to their home, still more helpless than themselves.</p>

<p class='c014'>I swept my hand across the grass, gathering up the dew,
which I drank greedily. Then I rolled over and over, bathing
my feet and my garments till my face came on a level with the
young larks. They uttered a cry, and opened their little golden
throats as if for food. This brought the mother-bird back
again, who circled over and over us, uttering her discontent in
wild gushes of song. The flutter of her plumage between my
eyes and the sun—the softened notes as she grew comforted by
my stillness—the flutter that seemed half smothered in thistle-down
still going on in the nest—the balmy air, the bath of
dew—some, perhaps all of these things slaked the fire in my
veins, and I fell asleep.</p>

<p class='c014'>Did I dream? Had I wandered off again into delirium, or
was the thing real? To this day I cannot tell; but as I lay in
that meadow which bounded the wayside, a long funeral procession
crept by me, fringing the meadow with blackness, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>gliding away sadly, dreamily, toward a village church, whose
spire cut between me and the sky.</p>

<p class='c014'>Time went by like thistle-down upon the wind. The sky was
purple above me. Thousands and thousands of great stars
twinkled dreamily through the deep stillness. The dew lay
upon me like a shower. I turned softly, and as I moved, the
lark stirred above her young. My sleep had been so like death
that the bird feared me no longer.</p>

<p class='c014'>If I had a connected thought it was this—the lark had come
back to her young; with her soft bosom she kept them from
the damp and cold night air. I was young: it was night: the
dew fell like rain: I had no strength to move. <em>Where was my
mother?</em></p>

<p class='c014'>I could not answer the question; my brain was too feeble, and
ached beneath the confused images that crowded upon it. The
funeral train, ridges of snow, heaped-up stones, flashes of crimson,
as if a red mantle were floating over me, disjointed fragments
like these were all the answer that came back to my
heart, as it drearily asked where am I? where is my mother?</p>

<p class='c014'>Probably another day went by; I do not know, for a heavenly
sleep settled on me. But at last—it must have been
sometime near noon—I saw the lark settle down by her nest
with some crumbs of bread in her bill. I watched the young
ones as they greedily devoured it, and a craving desire for
nourishment stole over me. I envied the little ragged birdlings,
and wondered how they could be so greedy and so selfish.</p>

<p class='c014'>The mother flew away again, and I watched her with longing
eyes. She might take compassion on my hunger. Surely those
greedy young ones had eaten enough. She would think of me
now that they were satisfied. How eagerly I watched for some
dark speck in the sky, some noise that should tell me of her
return! She came at last, shooting through the atmosphere
like an arrow. After whirling playfully over, and again above
our heads, she settled down by her nest, and I saw that her bill
was distended by a fine blackberry. The largest and sauciest
young one, who always crowded his brethren down into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>nest when food appeared, rose upward with a hungry flutter
and held his open bill quivering just beneath the delicious
berry.</p>

<p class='c014'>My heart swelled. I uttered an eager cry, and flung out my
hand. The lark, startled in affright, dropped the fruit, and it
fell into my palm. What did I care for the angry cry of the
old bird, or the commotion among her nestlings? The fruit
was melting away—oh, how deliciously!—between my parched
lips! When that was gone, I lifted my hands imploringly to
the angry bird, and asked for more. She was all the friend I
had, and it seemed as if she must understand my terrible want.
She went away and returned; but oh, how my poor heart
ached when she lighted, and with her eye turned saucily on me,
dropped a grain or two of wheat for her young!</p>

<p class='c014'>Tears crowded to my eyes. Who would aid me—so hungry,
so miserable, such a little creature, more helpless than the birds
of heaven, and they so pitiless? I turned my face away; the
young larks had become detestable to me. I was tempted to
hurt them, to dash my hand down into the nest and exterminate
the whole brood; but the very thought exhausted me, and I
began to weep again with faint sighs that would have been sobs
of anguish but for my prostration.</p>

<p class='c014'>I lifted my head and strove to sit upright, looking wearily
around with a vague expectation of help. At a little distance
was a stone wall, and climbing over it a blackberry bush in full
fruit, clusters on clusters glittering in the sunshine. The tears
rained down my cheeks. I turned my eyes upon the young
larks and feebly laughed out my triumph. I crept forward on
my hands and knees, pulled myself along by clenching handsful
of the meadow grass, and, at length, found myself prostrate
and panting by the wall. Most of the fruit was above my
reach, but some clusters fell low, and while my breast was
heaving and my poor hands trembled with exhaustion, I began
to gather and eat. Fortunately, it was impossible for me to
pluck enough of the fruit to injure myself, and with the grateful
taste in my mouth, I lay contemplating the clusters overhead
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>with dreamy longing, wondering when I should be able to
climb up the stones and gather them.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is strange that while my senses were so acute in all things
that pertained to my animal wants, all remembrance of the past
had forsaken me. I could neither remember who I was, nor
how I came to be alone in the meadow. My whole range of
sympathy and existence went back no farther than the lark’s
nest and its inmates, that had seemed to mock at my hunger in
the midst of their own abundance. Was it from this that I
drew my first lesson of sympathy for the destitute, and hate for
the heartless rich?</p>

<p class='c014'>Some vague remembrance of a tent that had sheltered me
did seem to haunt by brain; but when I lifted myself up by the
wall it had disappeared, and that, with the rest, floated away
into indistinctness. It was not that all memory of the past had
left me. I knew what the relations of life were—knew well
that I ought to have a mother to care for me—some one to
bring me food and arrange my garments; and, through the
cloudiness of my ideas, one beautiful face always looked down
upon me, like the rich, dark-eyed women whom we find repeated,
and yet varied over and over again in Murillo’s pictures. I
knew that this face should have been my mother’s, but all
around it was confused, like the clouds in which the great artist
sometimes buries his most ideal heads.</p>

<p class='c014'>But even this beautiful remembrance was floating and visionary.
I had no strength to grasp a continued thought. Even
the aspect of nature, the meadows, the distant woods, and the
gables of a building that shot up from their midst, had a novel
aspect. The feeble impression thus left was like that of bright
colors to an infant. I felt happier, more elastic. The world
seemed very beautiful, and a keen desire for action came upon
me. I tried to walk, but fell down like an infant making its
first attempt. I made another effort, tottered on a few paces,
and lay quietly down overcome with a desire to sleep. Then I
started again, creeping, staggering a little on my feet, resting
every few minutes, but all the while making progress toward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>the building whose gables I had seen in the distance. I had
no definite object; the instincts of humanity alone no doubt
induced me to seek a human habitation.</p>

<p class='c014'>I must have passed over the spot where the tent had stood,
for some loose hay littered the grass in one place, and among
it I found a crust of dry bread. I uttered a low shout, and
seizing it with both hands, sat down in the hay and began to
eat voraciously. Never, never have I tasted food so delicious.
I cannot think of it yet without a sensation of delight!</p>

<p class='c014'>As I sat devouring the precious morsel, there came a sweet
noise to my ear—a soft gurgle, that made me pause in my
exquisite banquet and listen. Old associations were not altogether
lost. I knew by the sound that a spring or brook was
near, and my joy broke forth in a laugh which overpowered the
flow of the waters. I crept on toward the sound, hoarding the
fragments of my crust. It was a beautiful little spring gushing
up from the cleft in a rock which lay cradled in a hollow close
by. The rock was covered with moss and the most delicate
lichen, thick with tiny, red drops, more beautiful than coral.
The water rushed down in a single stream, slender and graceful
as the flight of a silver arrow, and spread away with soft murmurs,
through the peppermint and cowslips that lined the
hollow. I drank of the water slowly, like a little epicure, enjoying
the cool taste on my lips with exquisite relish. Then,
enticed by the fragrance, I gathered a stem or two of the mint,
and laying the moist leaves on my bread, made a meal, such as
one never takes twice in a life-time.</p>

<p class='c014'>The waters gathered in a pretty pool beneath the rock, as
bright and scarcely larger than a good sized mirror. I turned,
after my bread was exhausted, and saw myself reflected in the
pool—not myself at the time, for I supposed it another child—a
poor, little, miserable thing, in an old dress of torn and soiled
embroidery, whose original richness gave force to its poverty-stricken
raggedness. Her little feet were bare and white, and
great, black eyes, illuminating a miserable pale face, like lamps
that could never burn out, were staring at me so wildly, that I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>flung out my arms to repulse her. She also flung up her bare
arms, and looked more like a weird thing than ever. The
action terrified me. I burst into tears, and clambered up the
hollow, looking back in terror lest the starved creature should
follow me.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXIII.<br> <span class='large'>THE THRESHOLD OF MY FATHER’S HOUSE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>I arose and moved forward, still keeping the gables in view,
now lying down on a bank for rest, now pausing to gather a
wild berry, but always diminishing the distance between myself
and the dwelling.</p>

<p class='c014'>The night came on, but excitement kept me wakeful. I had
no lonesome feelings. The skies above were crowded with stars,
that seemed like smiling play-fellows glad to have me in sight.
The moonbeams fell through the branches—for I was beneath
trees now—and played around me like a cloud of silver
butterflies. Then came the delicious scent of blossoms, the
trees grew thin, and velvet turf yielded luxuriously to my naked
feet. Beautiful flowers were budding around me, enameling the
turf in circles, mounds, and all sort’s of intricate figures. These,
like the stars, seemed old playmates. Fuchias, heliotrope,
moss roses—I recognized them with a gush of joy, and talked to
them softly as I stole along.</p>

<p class='c014'>A hard, gravel walk glistened before me, sweeping around
the proud old mansion whose gables I had seen. I entered it,
but the gravel hurt my feet, and leaving their little prints in
dew upon it, I turned an angle of the building. Now something
of terror, a vague, dark, impassable memory seemed floating
between me and the stars. A shadow from the building fell
over me like a pall. I grew cold and began to shiver, but still
moved on toward the moonlight.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>It was reached. I looked up, and before me was a great
stone doorway, surmounted with masses of dark marble,
chiselled so deeply that hollows seemed choked up with
shadows which contrasted densely with the moonbeams on the
surface. Half a dozen broad, granite steps led to the doorway.
I stood upon these steps and looked upward. A strange sensation
crept over me. I grew colder, weaker, and sunk upon
the stones with my head resting upon the door sill. A rush of
confused thoughts crowded upon my brain and stunned it. I
lay motionless, but with a vague idea of existence.</p>

<p class='c014'>The first thing that I remember was confused noises in the
dwelling, that sort of bee-like hum which accompanies the uprising
of a large household. Sometimes the sound of a door
jarred through my whole frame, and then I would drop away
into some stage of unconsciousness; it might be the sleep of
pure exhaustion, or insensibility, I cannot tell.</p>

<p class='c014'>At last there was a rustle and rush in the hall, the sound of
feet and brooms set in motion, with confused voices and the
ponderous movement of a door close to my head, that jarred
through and through me. A tumultuous sound of voices followed,
a hastily-dropped floor-brush fell across me—laughing,
exclamations, bustling and noise; then I heard a woman’s voice
say distinctly above the rest, “Ah! here comes one who knows
something—he can tell us what it is!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then a voice followed that sharpened my faculties like a
draught of wine, “Well, what are you chattering about the
door-stead for, like so many magpies around a church steeple?
Can the housekeeper find you no better business?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, come and see for yourself,” answered a peevish voice,
“is it a witch, an imp—a—a—do tell us, Mr. Turner, you who
have been in foreign parts and know all sorts of outlandish
creatures by heart?—look!—look!—its great black eyes are
wide open now; you can see them glistening through the hair
that lies all sorts of ways over its face. Gracious me, they burn
into one like a live coal!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Stand back,” said the male voice, “stand back, and let me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>have room. The creature is human! It may be—it may be—no,
no, poor, wild thing—no, no, God forbid!”</p>

<p class='c014'>The voice was broken, eager and full of anxiety. I felt the
long hair parted back from my forehead, and opening my eyes,
saw a little, old face, wrinkled and contracted, but oh, how
comforting!</p>

<p class='c014'>“Those great, wild eyes—those lips pinched, blue!—this
skeleton frame—no, no, not hers, thank God for that, I could
not have borne it!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What is the creature?—what shall we do with it?” inquired
the female voice.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What is it?” said the old man, looking up from my face,
“what is it? a human soul almost leaving the body—a child’s
soul! What is it?—don’t you see, woman?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Is it dying? can it speak?” was the rejoinder.</p>

<p class='c014'>The old man lifted me in his arms without answering, and
laid my head on his shoulder. A strange gush of pleasure
came over me, and my soul seemed melting away in tears—silent,
quiet tears, for I was too feeble for noisy emotions. I
stole one arm around his neck, and nestled my cheek close to
his. Was the action familiar to the old man? With me it
was natural as the infant’s habit of lifting its hands to the mother’s
mouth, that it may gather her kisses.</p>

<p class='c014'>He did not return the caress, but almost dropped me from
his arms. His bosom heaved, some exclamation that he seemed
about to utter broke into a groan, and directly I felt tears running
down the cheek that touched mine.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why, what are you about, Mr. Turner? What on earth
are you thinking of? Don’t you see how forlorn and ragged
the creature is, and holding it against your new mourning,
what has come over you?” exclaimed the housemaid, horrified
and astonished.</p>

<p class='c014'>The old man made no reply, but looked searchingly down on
my old frock, as if it had some deep interest to him.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Very well, every one to his own business,” cried the housemaid,
resenting his silence, “you hug that little witch as if it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>was your own—ha, ha, who knows!—who knows! oh, if my lord
could but see you!”</p>

<p class='c014'>The old man had been holding up a fold of my frock during
this speech, and was still intently examining the soiled embroidery.
His thin face writhed and twitched in all its features;
but when he dropped the fold, it settled into an expression of
distressing certainty.</p>

<p class='c014'>The old man looked on her with mournful sternness.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Before heaven, I wish he could see us—his old servant, and—and—tush!
woman, go about your work—go all!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I wonder how she come here, at any rate,” persisted the
housemaid, saucily. “Gracious goodness! but the thing does
seem to take to you, Mr. Turner, so natural. Isn’t it a sight to
behold?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Peace, woman!” cried the old man, stamping his foot till it
rang on the tessellated floor. “Have you no decency?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Decency, indeed!”</p>

<p class='c014'>As the housemaid tossed her head, with this pert rejoinder, a
tall, haughty woman came through a side door and moved
toward us. Her morning dress swept the marble as she walked,
and long silken tassels swayed the cord slowly to and fro, which
bound the sumptuous garment to her waist. She held a tiny
dog in her arms, which began to bark furiously as he saw
me.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What is all this?” she said, addressing Turner. “Something
found on the door-step?—where is it? what is it like?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Very like a hungry, sick, dying little girl,” replied Turner,
pressing me closer to him, “nothing more!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Who can it be? have you the least idea, Turner?” cried the lady.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I, madam—I, how can that be?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Don’t hide its face, Turner. Is it pretty? Hush, Tip.
Jealous already—there, there!”</p>

<p class='c014'>While the lady was soothing her dog, Turner, with much
reluctance and many distortions, turned my head upon his
bosom, and the lady saw my face. She started.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>“Heavens!—why, it is a perfect little animal!” she exclaimed,
drawing back. “What eyes!—how frightfully large! Mr.
Turner, Mr. Turner, how very imprudent in you! It may be
contagious fever or small-pox. Do take the creature away!”</p>

<p class='c014'>She drew slowly back while giving this command, with a look
of absolute terror.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Take her away—quite away!” she kept repeating.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Shall I leave her on the door-steps, madam?” said he, with
a sort of rebuking humor.</p>

<p class='c014'>There was something so familiar about his curt, dry way of
putting the question, that I felt more at home with him than
ever.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Turner—Turner, this is trifling, inexcusable! but that you
are a favorite servant of my poor brother’s, I would not endure
it an instant.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am a man! At least I was, till this poor, poor—there I
am at it again—till she made me cry like a baby for the first time
in my life; but I will obey you—I will carry her off, not that
her disease is contagious—souls are not catching, at any rate,
in this neighborhood.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The old man muttered over these last words to himself;
then lifting his voice said in a more respectful tone, “Madam,
your orders—where am I to place the child?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Anywhere. It is not of the least consequence—take it
down to the village. I fancy some of the tenants would like it
of all things. I have no right to receive incumbrances in Lord
Clare’s house during his absence.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Lord Clare never sent a starving fellow-creature from his
door yet,” answered Turner, stoutly. “It is not in him.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Starving?—what horrible words! Why, no one starves on
this estate.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Turner did not listen. He was looking down into my face,
his countenance stirring as one who ponders over a painful subject.
I lay feebly in his arms, contented as a lamb, my little
heart beating tenderly against his bosom. At last he carried
me out into the open air.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXIV.<br> <span class='large'>A PARADISE OF REST.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Turner walked fast, without speaking, till the shadow of
some tall trees fell over us, then his step grew heavier, and he
looked in my face from time to time, with an expression of
strange tenderness.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Do you remember me?” he said at last, but in a hesitating
whisper.</p>

<p class='c014'>I struggled hard with my weakness, and tried to think.
“Speak, little one, we are all alone, don’t be afraid of me,
old Turner you know.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, yes,” I murmured faintly enough, “she called you
Turner.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“She! what she are you talking of, little one?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“The tall lady up yonder with the dog,” I answered; for
struggle as I would, my mind refused to go farther back.</p>

<p class='c014'>He looked at me with a strange expression.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then it was not your—your mother?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Instantly that face half buried in clouds came before me.</p>

<p class='c014'>“She—my mother never speaks,” I said, “she looks at me
through the clouds, but does not say a word.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He stopped, gazed at me wistfully a moment, and then bending
his head closer to mine, whispered, “Tell me, tell old
Turner, where is she?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“She—who?” I whispered back.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Your mother, Aurora—your mother, child.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I don’t know, she was here just now.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Here!” he said, looking around, “here?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Did you not see her face among the clouds, close down
here, a minute ago? I did.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>He felt my cheek with his palm, took hold of my hands and
feet—“She has no fever,” he muttered, “what does all this
mean?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Tell me,” he said, after a little, “where did you go—you
and your mother?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Nowhere.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What, was she in the neighborhood?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Not—speak, child! not within a few weeks, not since
Lady Clare died?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I think she is always with me, but the lark fed her young
ones when they wanted something to eat, but she never fed me,
and I was very, very hungry. Why did she look upon me
from the clouds, but never give me one morsel to eat or a drop
to drink?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Poor child—poor, poor child,” said the old man, kissing
me, oh, how tenderly—“try and think—make one effort—I do
so want to know the truth—where have you been these many
months?”</p>

<p class='c014'>I tried to think, but it confused me, and at last I answered,
with starting tears,</p>

<p class='c014'>“Indeed, I do not know.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He bent his face close to mine, and kissed away the tears
that stood on my cheeks—then he questioned me again.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Is your mother dead?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Dead! the word struck like cold iron upon my heart. I shuddered
on the old man’s bosom. My brain ached with the
weight of some painful memory, but it gave back no distinct
answer. It seemed as if his question had heaped mountains of
snow around me, but I could only reply,</p>

<p class='c014'>“Dead, what is that?”</p>

<p class='c014'>He heaved a deep groan and walked on, muttering strangely
to himself.</p>

<p class='c014'>I knew that he was carrying me over innumerable flower
beds, for the air was rich with the scent of heliotrope and
flowering daphnas, the breath of my old playmates. Then he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>mounted up some steps, tearing his way through a quantity
of vines, and forcing open a sash window with his foot, carried
me in.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was a luxurious apartment, but very gloomy, and silent
as a catacomb. The shutters were closed, the air unwholesome
and heavy with the odor of dead flowers. I saw nothing
distinctly, though my eyes roved with a sort of fascination from
object to object. Something deeper than memory stirred in my
soul. A chillness seized me, and I longed to go away.</p>

<p class='c014'>Turner passed on, evidently glad to leave the chamber, and
did not pause again till we reached a room that was smaller
and more cheerful. He held me with one arm, and with his
right hand threw open the shutters.</p>

<p class='c014'>The sash was a single piece of plate glass, transparent as
water. Curtains of gossamer lace and rose-colored silk fell
over it, through which the morning sunshine glowed like the
dawning of a rainbow.</p>

<p class='c014'>The old man made me sit up in his arms and look around
while he curiously regarded my face. I have said the room
was flooded with soft light. The walls were covered with
hangings of a delicate tint, sprinkled with rose buds. A carpet
of snowy ground, with bouquets of gorgeous flowers scattered
over it, as if in veritable bloom, covered the floor. A diminutive
easy-chair and sofa, cushioned with rose-colored silk stood
opposite to a small bed of gilded ivory, gleaming through a
cloud of gossamer lace, which fell in soft, snowy waves from
a small hoop of white and gold, like the bedstead, swung to
the ceiling by a cord and tassel of silk, twisted with golden
threads.</p>

<p class='c014'>Turner looked at me anxiously, as my eyes wandered around
this beautiful room, fitted up evidently for a child—for the
bedstead was scarcely larger than a crib, and everything bore
evidence of a very youthful occupant.</p>

<p class='c014'>A pleasant sensation crept over me, as I gazed languidly
around. The atmosphere seemed familiar, and I felt a smile
stealing to my mouth.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>Turner saw it, and almost laughed through the tears that
were clouding his eyes.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Do you like this?” he whispered, softly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, yes, so much!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Shall I put you into that pretty bed?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, no!” I shrieked, with a sudden pang, “it is white
like a snow-drift; I would rather go back to the meadow and
sleep with the larks.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The old man looked sad again. He carried me close to the
bed, and put some folds of the curtain in my hand; but I
shrank back appalled by their unmixed whiteness. He could
not comprehend this shuddering recoil, but sought to remove
the cause. Curtains of silk, like those at the window, were
looped through the ivory hoop. These he shook loose till
they mingled in bright blossom colored waves with the lace.
Then I began to smile again, and a sweet home feeling stole
over me.</p>

<p class='c014'>Turner carried me in his arms to the door and called aloud.
A woman answered, and came into the room. When her eyes
fell upon me they dilated, grew larger, and she uttered a few
rapid words in some language that I did not understand.
Turner answered her in the same tongue, then all at once she
fell upon her knees, and raising her clasped hands began to
weep.</p>

<p class='c014'>Turner addressed her again, and with eager haste she prepared
a bath, brought forth night clothes of the finest linen,
and laid me in the bed exhausted, but tranquil and sleepy.</p>

<p class='c014'>I heard Turner and the woman moving softly around my
bed. I knew that tears and kisses were left upon my face,
and then I slept, oh, how sweetly!</p>

<p class='c014'>Ah, what heavenly dreams possessed me during the days and
weeks which I spent in that delightful little chamber! The delirium
which accompanied my relapse into fever was like an experience
in fairy land. Fantastic as the visions that haunted
me were, the most glowing changes of beauty broke through
them all. Music floated by me on each breath of air that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>gushed through the windows. Every sunbeam that stole
through the gossamer curtains arched over me like a rainbow.
It seemed to me that whole clouds of humming-birds floated
through the room, filling it with the faint music of their wings.
Then the pretty myths were chased away by fantastic little
creatures in human form; smiling, fluttering, and full of the
most exquisite fun, they trampled over my bed, and nestled,
mischievously, among the blossom colored hangings. I became
wild with admiration of their rosy bloom, of their comical ways.
I laughed at their pranks by the hour, and strove with insane
glee to catch them with my hand, or imprison them under the
bed-clothes. But they always evaded me, making the most
grotesque faces at my baffled efforts. I could see them waltzing
in dozens upon the counterpane, and sitting upon my pillow
tangling their tiny hands and feet in my hair, shouting, laughing,
and turning summersets like little mad-caps whenever I
made a dart at them with my hands. So we kept it up, these
exquisite little imps, night and day, for we never slept—not we!
the fun was too good for that!</p>

<p class='c014'>There were only two of these creatures that did not seem to
enjoy themselves, and they were so odd, such droll, tearful,
melancholy things, that somehow their faces always made us
stop laughing, though we could not suppress a giggle now and
then at their solemn and sentimental way of doing things.</p>

<p class='c014'>One was a queer little sprite, that looked so exquisitely droll
with that tiny hat set upon his powdered hair, and the face
underneath so comically anxious, that it quite broke my heart
to look at the little fellow standing there with the tears in his
eyes.</p>

<p class='c014'>I remember puzzling myself a long time regarding the materials
which composed his vest and small clothes, and of satisfying
myself that they must have been made from the leaves of a
tiger lily, peony, or some other great crimson blossom. The
grave, drab coat, with its red facings, the golden buckles and
hat, defied my imagination altogether; but the face, that
anxious face, was dear old Turner’s, withered up to the size of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>a crab-apple. It seemed so sad, so mournful, I quite pitied
him, but somehow couldn’t keep from laughing at the priggish
little figure he cut. Then there was a funny little woman, just
the least bit shorter, in a blue dress and large cap, held up by
the queerest high-backed comb that spread out the crown like
a fan. Her face was older and darker than the rest, a Spanish
face, with something kind in it that sometimes kept me quiet
minutes together. These two figures really saddened us—the
rosy troop of sprites and myself—with their grave faces and
muttered consultations with each other, as if life and death depended
on what they were talking about.</p>

<p class='c014'>Then the scene would change. These elfin revellers disappeared.
Flashes of lightning and clouds of cold white snow
came slowly over me, drifting, drifting, drifting; and in their
midst that beautiful face, so icy, so white, with its great,
mournful eyes looking down into mine, hour after hour—it
haunted me then, it has haunted me ever since. Yet no fear
ever came upon me; no superstitious dread crept through my
frame; but a chillness, as if mountain snow were around me,
nothing more.</p>

<p class='c014'>At last this strange phantasmagoria cleared away; the
elves gave up their gambols and disappeared, all but the old
man and the woman. They gradually grew larger, and I knew
that they were the good Spanish woman and Turner.</p>

<p class='c014'>How tenderly these two persons nursed me during the slow
convalescence that followed! How ardent was the love I
gave back for this care, for mine was an impassioned nature!
Every sensation that I knew, love, hate, grief, fear—nay, not
fear, I think that was unknown to my nature from the first!—but
all other sensations were passions in me. Generous sentiments
predominated with me always. I say this when my life
lies before me like a map, and every impulse of my soul has
been analyzed with impartiality, and knowledge more searching
than any man or woman ever gathered from the actions of his
fellow man.</p>

<p class='c014'>I saw Turner at stated periods, when he could escape from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>Greenhurst to inquire after my comforts, and caress me in his
quaint, tender fashion. I had learned to watch for the hour of
his coming with the most ardent impatience. He always brought
me some pretty gift, if it were only a branch of hawthorn in
flower, an early crocus, or a hatful of violets. He was an old,
kind-hearted bachelor, and the poor child who had crept to his
feet from the wayside, became the very pet and darling of a
heart that had but one other idol on earth, and that was Lord
Clare, his master.</p>

<p class='c014'>Maria and I were alone in the house. The language in which
she addressed me was not that which I spoke with Turner, but
her caresses, her eager love were even more demonstrative than
his. There was a pathos and power in her expressions of
tenderness that he doubtless felt, but could not manifest in his
own rougher language. She carried me in her arms while I
was unable to walk, and sat by me as I played wearily with
the rich toys, of which she found an endless variety in the
closets and hidden places about the cottage.</p>

<p class='c014'>I spoke her language well and without effort, for it seemed
more native to my tongue than the English; and sometimes I
would address Turner in some of its rich terms of endearment,
but he always checked me with a grimace, as if the sound were
hateful.</p>

<p class='c014'>There was another language, too, of which I had learned the
sounds, but whether it was of human origin, or something that
I had gathered from the wild birds, I could not tell. It had a
meaning to me, but no one else understood it, and so, like the
feelings to which this strange gift alone gave utterance, it was
locked up in my heart to be hoarded and pondered over in
secret.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXV.<br> <span class='large'>MYSELF AND MY SHADOW.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>I do not know how Turner managed to establish me in this
luxurious home, but Lord Clare had left him with power to act,
and I suppose he exercised it in my behalf, without consulting
Lady Catherine. In fact, the cottage had for years been considered
as his residence.</p>

<p class='c014'>I grew stronger and more contented as time went on. The
stillness, the bright atmosphere, and the love with which I was
surrounded, hushed my soul back into childhood again, for up to
this time I can remember but few thoughts or sensations that
partook of my infant years.</p>

<p class='c014'>In truth, there was something fairy-like in my position, well
calculated to excite an imagination vivid as mine to most unhealthy
action. Sometimes it seemed to me as if I had been a
child of the air, for my first memory went back to the lark’s nest
in the meadow; and my earliest idea of enjoyment was rich with
bird music. Good as Turner and Maria were, it never entered
my mind to consider myself as absolutely belonging to them,
more subtle and refined affinities existed within me.</p>

<p class='c014'>Everything that surrounded me was calculated to excite these
feelings. The utmost prodigality of wealth could have supplied
nothing of the beautiful or refined which was not mysteriously
bestowed on me. The clothes I wore, my toys and books were
of the most exquisite richness. The texture of everything I
touched was of peculiar delicacy; thus a natural worship of the
beautiful, inherent in my nature, was fed and pampered as if by
magic. The house contained a library of richly bound books,
in many languages, mostly classical, or on subjects of foreign
interest. Few romances were among the collection, but the
poets of all countries were well represented. The best poetry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>of Italy, Germany and Spain, the ancient classics, and mythological
subjects predominated. Many of these volumes were in
the original language, but there was no lack of English translations.
The most remarkable thing about this collection was an
entire deficiency in the works of native authors. A few of the
poets were to be found, Milton and two or three others, but
everything calculated to give an insight into the social life or
history of England, seemed to have been excluded with vigilance.</p>

<p class='c014'>The small hexagonal room which contained these books was
connected with my sleeping-chamber by a small gallery lined
with pictures. Two or three statuettes, copies from the great
masters, occupied pedestals in this gallery, and the lights were
so arranged that every inspiration of the genius that had given
life to the canvas or the marble, was thrown forward as by a
kindred mind. This room and its gallery, unlike most of the
other apartments, were left unlocked, and, with my imagination
on fire with the legends in which Maria was constantly indulging,
I loved to wander along the gallery, and ponder over the
pictures, filling each landscape with some scene of active life,
and reading a destiny in the strange faces that looked down
upon me from the wall.</p>

<p class='c014'>But more especially did the statuettes become objects of admiration,
probably because they touched some latent talent of my own,
and awoke a desire of emulation. Even at this early period of
my life, I felt an appreciation of the beauty in form and proportion
so exquisitely maintained in these objects, keen as the
desire of a hungry person for food. An awkward position, an
ill arranged article of furniture, cross lights upon a picture,
anything which outraged that exquisite sense of the perfect,
which has been both my happiness and my bane, was as vivid
with me before I knew a rule of art as it is now.</p>

<p class='c014'>So with this inherent sense of the beautiful guiding me like a
sunbeam, I made play-fellows of the breathing marble and of
pictures so rare, as I have since learned, that a monarch might
have coveted them. I grew ambitious to emulate the marble
in my own person, and amused myself, hour after hour, in practising
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>the graceful position which each maintained on its pedestal.
This grew tiresome at length, and impelled by the genius
within me, I began to invent and arrange new combinations for
myself, before the large mirror that reflected back the gallery
and all it contained, when my chamber door was open.</p>

<p class='c014'>Was I struck by the vision of childish beauty that broke
upon me from the mirror during these efforts? Yes! as I was
pleased with the paintings upon the wall, or the statues that
gleamed in their chaste beauty around me. I loved the wild,
little creature that stood mocking my gestures in the mirror,
because she was more brilliant than the paintings, and more
life-like than the marble—because her arch eyes were so full
of the life that glowed in my own bosom. Ah, yes, I loved the
child. Why not? She alone seemed my equal. I did not
reflect that she was the shadow of myself, or in truth identify
her with my own existence at all. She seemed to me like a
new picture going through another progression toward life.
They were so changeless; but she was variable as a hummingbird.
She smiled, moved, looked a thousand things from those
great flashing eyes. Oh, if she could have spoken, I was sure
in my heart that she might have uttered that strange, hidden
language of mine.</p>

<p class='c014'>So I met the wild, little beauty each day in the mirror.
Every graceful curve and line of the statues had become familiar,
and almost wearisome to me, but here was infinite variety
changing at my will. She was my slave, my subject, a being
over whom I had absolute control; and this was the first idea
that I ever had of companionship.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the library I found some books still done up in brown
paper packages, as if ordered for some purpose and forgotten.
These, of course, became objects of especial curiosity to a child
always on the alert for discoveries. They were juvenile volumes,
richly illustrated, containing all the fairy tales, I do
believe, ever invented or translated into the English language.</p>

<p class='c014'>I seized upon these books with eagerness, studied the pictures,
and made toilsome efforts to spell out their meaning. So between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>Maria’s reading, and my own spelling out of words, we
gathered up all the glowing romance; and this opened new
visions to me, and gave a vivid impulse to my day dreamings
among the pictures. It was only my wild spirit that wandered.
At first the debility that followed my illness, and afterward
Turner’s earnest prohibition, confined me to the house, or, as a
great indulgence, to the little flower nook directly under the
windows.</p>

<p class='c014'>A winter and spring went by, and then my fairy-like imprisonment
ceased. Old Turner grew cheerful and indulgent; he
gave me long walks among the trees; he brought a pretty
black pony upon which I rode, while he walked by my saddle.</p>

<p class='c014'>My frame grew vigorous, and my spirits bird-like, under this
wholesome indulgence. Sometimes I caught glimpses of Greenhurst,
and a vivid remembrance of the morning Turner had
found me upon its door-steps, came back upon my brain. I
wondered if the lady, with her dog, and that long, silver-grey
morning-robe, was there yet, and if I should ever see her again.
As my courage and curiosity grew strong, I inquired about
these things of Turner. “No, the lady was not there,” he
said, “she had gone up to London, to be near her son, who was
at Eton.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Where was London? Who was her son? What was
Eton?</p>

<p class='c014'>How eagerly I crowded all these questions together, when,
for the first time, I found the dear old man disposed to indulge
my curiosity. London, Eton were soon explained, but they
still seemed like the cities I had read of in my fairy books. But
when he told me of this son, that he was Lord Clare’s nephew,
and might one day become owner of Greenhurst, our own pretty
home, and the broad fields and parks around us to the horizon
almost, my heart fell, my thoughts grew dark, and for a moment
the beautiful landscape disappeared. A cold mist surrounded
me. It was but for a moment, but why was it? How came
this bleak vision to encompass me thus with its dreary indistinctness?
Had some name jarred on my memory which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>refused to receive it, and yet felt the shock? Was that name
Lord Clare’s? Why had neither Turner nor Maria ever mentioned
him before? Who was he? What was Turner to him?</p>

<p class='c014'>I asked these questions at once. Turner answered in a low
voice, and I fancied with reluctance. Certain I am, his voice
was more husky than usual.</p>

<p class='c014'>He explained that Lord Clare was his master—that he had
gone into foreign lands, and might not come back for years.
The lady whom I had seen was his sister, unlike him in everything,
but still his sister; and during his absence her home was
to be at Greenhurst whenever it might be her pleasure to reside
there.</p>

<p class='c014'>We had ridden to the brow of an eminence on the verge of
the park while Turner was giving me this intelligence. The
spot commanded a fine view of the country far and near. In a
sweeping curve of the distant uplands stood a dark stone dwelling,
partially castellated and partaking of a style which admits
of towers and balconies, so ornamented that it was impossible
to guess to what age they belonged. It was an imposing building,
and made both a grand and picturesque object, lapped as
it was among the most verdant and lovely hills in the world. I
looked toward this building with interest. It seemed like something
I had seen before, pictured perhaps in a book.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And that,” said I, pointing toward the distance, “that
house yonder among the purple hills, is that Lord Clare’s also?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“That,” said Turner, with a sigh, and shading his eyes with
his withered hand, “that is Marston Court.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He paused, shook his head mournfully, and then, remembering
that the name was not a full answer to my question, continued,
“Yes, yes, that is Lord Clare’s also. It came to him
through—through his—his—through Lady Clare.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And who lives yonder, dear Turner?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No one; it is shut up.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I think,” said I, leaning down toward the old man, who
stood with one arm thrown over the neck of my pony, “I think
this world must have very few people in it for all that you tell
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>me. No one at Greenhurst—no one out yonder—only you and
Maria and me among these woods and fields.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And is not that enough, child?”</p>

<p class='c014'>I shook my head.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Are you not happy with us, Zana? What more do you
want?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I want,” said I, kindling with the idea, “I want to see a
child; you tell me the world is full of little girls and boys like
me—where are they?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I have thought of this before,” muttered Turner, uneasily,
“it’s natural—it’s what I should have expected. What company
are the Spanish woman and such a dry old chip as I am
for a creature like this?”</p>

<p class='c014'>His look of annoyance disturbed me. I could not bear to
see his old face so wrinkled with anxiety.</p>

<p class='c014'>“We should have to take a long journey to find the children,
I suppose,” said I, hoping to relieve his perplexity; “but Jupiter
here is so strong, and so swift, if you could but keep up
with him now, we might search for them, you know.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The old man still looked anxious, and bore down heavily on
the neck of my beautiful steed with his arm.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Don’t,” said I, “you will hurt Jupiter; see how his head
droops.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Poor thing, I would not hurt him for the world, if it were
only for her sake,” said the old man, smoothing the arched neck
of Jupiter with his palm; “next to you, Zana, I think she
loved this pretty animal.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Who—who was it that loved Jupiter so?” I inquired, with
eager curiosity.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Your mother,” replied the old man, and the words dropped
like tears from his lips.</p>

<p class='c014'>“My mother,” I repeated, looking upward, and solemnly
expecting to see that sweet face gazing down upon me from
the clouds. “Let us go home, dear Turner, I am growing
cold; do not say that again, the sound drifts over me here like
a snow-heap, it hurts me.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>Turner seemed to struggle with himself. Then lifting his
eyes to my face, as if he had nerved his resolution to say something
very painful, he answered,</p>

<p class='c014'>“One minute, Zana! Tell me, child, what is it that makes
you turn white and shiver so, when I speak as I did now of
your mother?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I do not know!” I replied, looking upward, with anxiety.
“The cold is here at my heart, I do not know why.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Do you remember your mother? Now that you are well,
something of the past should come back to you. Child, make
an effort—that mother—what has become of her?”</p>

<p class='c014'>I only shuddered—but had no reply to give; I could feel,
but all was blank and blackness to my thoughts.</p>

<p class='c014'>Turner saw my distress, and his own become more and more
visible. He looked upon the ground and began muttering to
himself, a habit that he had when very much perplexed. His
thoughts reached me in disjointed snatches, but I dwelt upon
them long after.</p>

<p class='c014'>“How can I send him word? What can I say? Even
proof of her own identity is wanting—proof that would satisfy
him. Besides, his anxiety was for her—poor thing—even more
than the child. If she could but be made to remember. Zana,
Zana!” he burst forth, grasping my arm, and looking imploringly
into my face, “struggle with this apathy of mind—strive,
think—tell me, child, tell me something that I can get for a
clue! Tell me if you can—try, try, my pretty Zana, and you
shall have troops of children to play with. Tell me, where was
it that you parted with your mother?”</p>

<p class='c014'>I did make an effort to remember. My veins chilled; my
cheeks grew cold as ice; I lifted my finger upward and pointed
to a bank of clouds rolling in fleecy whiteness over us.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Is that all?” exclaimed Turner, despairingly.</p>

<p class='c014'>I could not speak, my lips seemed frozen. I sat like a marble
child upon the back of my pony; everything around me had
turned to snow once more.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>Tears rolled down Turner’s cheeks, great, cold tears, that
looked like hail-stones—they made me shiver afresh.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was the last time that Turner ever tortured me with questions
regarding my mother—questions that I had no power to
answer, yet which brought with them such mysterious, such
indescribable pain. Later, when my soul was called back from
the past—but of this hereafter.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXVI.<br> <span class='large'>THE FAIRY AT THE POOL.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>One day I had wandered through the garden and out among
the brave old chestnuts quite alone, for now that the family were
absent, Turner allowed me to wander almost at will anywhere
between the old mansion and our more humble, but not less
lovely home.</p>

<p class='c014'>This time I took one of the great chestnut avenues hitherto
unexplored, which led me, by a curving sweep, to the lodge,
which I just remembered having passed in my progress from
the meadows, on the memorable night when Turner found me
upon the door-steps. Then it had seemed like a cliff, adown
which great festoons of ivy were sweeping to the ground.
Now I saw the thick foliage turned and forced back here and
there, to admit light into the doors and windows of a rustic
cottage, which had a stir of life within, though I saw no
person.</p>

<p class='c014'>I passed this lodge with a stealthy tread, for a sense of disobedience
troubled me, I knew, without having been directly
told, that both Turner and Maria would disapprove my passing
beyond the limits of the park; but childish curiosity, with some
vague remembrance of the place, were too strong for my sense
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>of right, and I passed on quite charmed with the broad slope
of meadow land that lay before me, all golden, crimson and
white with mid-summer blossoms. A village with a church tower
in the distance rose upon my view like a glimpse of fairy land.
I felt then that the world, as Turner asserted, was full of people,
and longed to know more about them.</p>

<p class='c014'>I walked along the carriage track which wound toward the
village through thick hedges just out of blossom, holding my
breath as I recognized here a moss-covered stone, there a
hillock, upon which I had set down to rest on that wearisome
night. The grass was green and fresh where the tent had been,
to which my first remembrance went back, but I recollected the
place well. As I stood gazing on it, the soft gurgle of waters
fell upon my ear as it had then, and induced, half by a feeling
that seemed like terror, half by curiosity, I moved toward the
hollow, wondering if I should find that impish little figure waiting
for me again.</p>

<p class='c014'>I reached the slope, looked half timidly down, and remained
breathless and lost in delight.</p>

<p class='c014'>Upon the rock which I have mentioned covered with lichen
and mossy grasses, sat a little girl, about my own age, I should
think, busy with a quantity of meadow blossoms that filled the
crown of a straw bonnet that stood by her side. All around
her lay the gathered blossoms; her tiny feet were buried in
them; they gleamed through the skirt of her muslin dress, and
brightened the rock all around. She coquetted with them like
a bird—bending her head on one side as she held a cluster of
violets in the sun, flinging it back with a graceful curve of the
neck, when they dropped into shadow, and eyeing them coyly
all the time, as a robin regards the cherry he intends to appropriate
at leisure.</p>

<p class='c014'>What eyes the creature had! large and of a purplish blue,
like the violets she held, and so full of smiling brightness.
Never before or since have I seen a creature so beautiful, so
full of graceful bloom. Her profuse hair was in disorder, falling
in golden waves and curls all over her white shoulders, from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>which the transparent sleeve was drawn with knots of blue
ribbon, leaving the prettiest dimples in the world exposed.
Her mouth was soft, red, and smiling like ripe cherries in the
sunshine, and that rosy smile, so innocent in its tenderness,
so radiant with glee! Talk of women not feeling the glow of
each other’s beauty; why, there is no feeling on earth so
unselfish, so full of lofty, tender admiration as the love which
one high-souled woman feels for the sister woman to whom her
soul goes forth in sympathy. This appreciation, these attachments
are not frequent in society, but when they do exist, the
loves of the angels are almost realized. Sometimes the same
feeling extends to children, but not often.</p>

<p class='c014'>I looked down upon this child, thus busy with her graceful
flowers, and my heart filled with the sunshine of her presence.
As she trifled with her garlands, the smile broke into music
on her red lips, and a few soft chirping notes, wild and untaught
as a bird’s, blended richly with the flowing waters.</p>

<p class='c014'>At last she lifted a half-twined garland high over her head,
that the sunshine might kindle up its blossoms, and as her eyes
were turned upward they fell upon me. The garland hung
motionless in her hand; the song died on her lips, leaving them
like an opening rose-bud; and her blue eyes filled with a look
of pleasant wonder. Thus, for the moment, we gazed upon
each other, we who were to be a destiny each to the other.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Come,” she said at last, pushing her straw hat toward me
so eagerly that a quantity of flowers rolled over the brim,
through which the broad strings rippled in azure waves—“come,
there is enough for us both, let us pelt the brook and
hear the water laugh as it runs away with them. Here, jump
to the rock, I will make room. Now for it!”</p>

<p class='c014'>She gathered up her skirt, crushing the blossoms with her
little dimpled arms, pushed back the bonnet, and left a space
upon the stone for me to occupy.</p>

<p class='c014'>I sprang down the bank breathing quickly, and with my
whole frame in a joyful glow, I placed myself among the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>blossoms, wove my arms about the charming infant’s, and kissed
her shoulders till she laughed aloud, as a bird breaks into
music at the first sight of a kindred songster.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Come,” said the child, her voice still rich with glee—“come,
let us go to work; which will you have, violets, primroses,
or some of these pretty white stars that I found by the
brook?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“All, all,” I answered, with animation, “give them to me,
and mind what a pretty crown I shall make for your hair.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She turned her great wondering eyes on me as I wove the
blossoms together—the violets with golden primroses, intermingling
them with leaves and spears of long grass, a white
star gleaming out here and there in silvery relief.</p>

<p class='c014'>When she saw my garland, so different from her own, in
which the flowers were grouped without method, the child
seemed lost in admiration. After gazing on it a moment, and
then upon me, she took her own half-formed wreath and cast
it upon the brooklet with a charming little pout of the lips,
that was lovely almost as her smiles had been.</p>

<p class='c014'>I went on with my coronal, enjoying the task as an author
does his poem, or a painter his picture. The buds harmonized
under my fingers; their symmetrical grace filled my soul with
the delight which springs from a natural love of the beautiful.
Even at that age I had all the feelings of an artist, all that
love of praise which holds a place in those feelings.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Ah,” said I, weaving my wreath among her golden curls,
“if you could see how beautiful you are together, you and the
flowers.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I can see,” cried the child, springing up and scattering
a shower of blossoms from the folds of her frock which fell
into the water, disturbing it till it looked like a shattered
mirror. “No, not now, naughty thing that I am, to make
the poor brook so angry with my flowers—but wait a minute,
and you shall see!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, no, not there!” cried I, seizing her in breathless fear,
for I remembered the hideous thing that had frightened me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>from the depths of those very waters; “don’t look in the
water; let us go away. It may be lurking here yet.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What?” questioned the child, anxiously.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Something that I saw here once, a wild, wicked creature,
with such eyes and hair”——</p>

<p class='c014'>“What, in the water?” she asked, her blue eyes growing
wider and larger.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, here in the pool, just by this rock.”</p>

<p class='c014'>We both stood up clinging to one another. In our upright
position the pool lay clear and tranquil beneath us, and impelled
by that sort of fascination which in moments of affright
often turns the gaze upon that which it dreads to see, our eyes
fell at the same moment upon two objects reflected back as
from a mirror—my little friend, so like one of those cherubs
which Raphael half buries amid the transparent clouds in his
pictures—and that other little friend, with whom I had become
acquainted in the mirror at home.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Ah, how came she here? Is she your friend also?” I said,
pointing toward the dark brilliant child that pointed back to
me, with a questioning smile as I spoke.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Who, that?” asked my companion, waving her hand—a
gesture that was sent back, as it seemed, with new grace from
the water.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why, don’t you know it again?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, but do you? Does it ever speak to you, or only stand
looking like that?”</p>

<p class='c014'>She gazed at me with her wondering eyes, and then at the
images beneath us.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why, don’t you know me, there with the wreath on?—and
you? it is so droll that any one should not know herself.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I caught my breath.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What?” I exclaimed, “does that child look like me? is it
me?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why, yes, who else, please?” cried my companion gaily,
“see, it is your hair, so black, and your pretty frock too; and
the eyes, they look like stars in the water.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>I looked upon the two figures, the fair, blooming little beauty—the
dark, earnest, haughty but sparkling face that bent over
her. After a moment, I said slowly, as if speaking of a picture,
“yes, it is me, and I am beautiful!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Indeed you are,” exclaimed the child, with a gaiety that
disturbed me, for this conviction of my own loveliness gave a
serious, almost sad impression to my thoughts; “papa calls me
his blossom, you shall be his star. Shall she not, my own
darling papa?”</p>

<p class='c014'>I looked up and saw a gentleman standing upon the bank
looking calmly, and with a gentle smile upon us as we stood.
He was dressed in black, somewhat worn, and had a subdued
meekness in his deportment, which won my childish heart in an
instant.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, Cora, are you ready to return home?” he said, with
a quiet smile.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, yes, papa,” she cried, unwinding her arms from mine,
and leaping from the rock. “Good-bye, come to-morrow,” she
cried, clambering up the bank, and pausing at the top to
shower back kisses with both hands; “do you hear? Come
to-morrow, my star”——</p>

<p class='c014'>The gentleman took her hand and led her away. I watched
them till they disappeared, and then sunk upon the rock crying
disconsolately. It seemed as if my life had again just begun,
and was swept away into darkness.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXVII.<br> <span class='large'>FUNERALS AND ORPHANS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>All that night I lay awake, thinking of the morrow, longing
for daylight, and so impatient of the darkness around me, that
I left my bed again and again to fling aside the curtains and
search for a glow in the east. I had told my adventure, and
described the beautiful child to Maria, my kind bonne. She
heard it all with pleasant curiosity, but strove to subdue the
wild impatience with which I panted for another interview with
this heavenly creature of my own sex and age.</p>

<p class='c014'>The next day I started for the spring, and reached it in a
glow of expectation, panting with the eager affection that
burned like a fire in my bosom. Nothing was there. The
grey rock, with its trampled lichen, the pool sleeping softly
beneath it, and the sweet current rippling through clusters of
fragrant mint, alone met my ear and gaze. A few dead blossoms
lay upon the rock, tormenting me with a withered memento
of the joy I had known the day before. I sat down
among these blossoms and cried with bitter disappointment.
After waiting hours in the hot sun, I returned home weary and
disheartened. Why had she broken her promise? How could
I ever trust her again if she did come to the spring? Who
was she, a real being, or a fairy, who, for one moment had
taken pity on my loneliness, to leave me more desolate than
before?</p>

<p class='c014'>My hopes of seeing her again began to falter greatly after
the third day, but still I persisted on going to the rock every
morning for a week. The dead flowers among the lichen went
to my heart every time I saw them, but I had no courage to
brush them into the water; they were, at least, a proof that I
had seen her.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>One morning, after brooding over my disappointment, wondering
and watching as a child, with a heart in its wish, only
can wait and watch, I shook away the tears from my eyes and
sprang up, nerved with a sort of inspiration. I would search
for the child—wander right and left till she was found. I
would mourn no more, but go to work, nor yield again to tears
while an effort could be made to find her for whose presence I
pined.</p>

<p class='c014'>I clambered up the bank, crossed into the highroad, and
wandered on toward the village that lay in lovely quietude
before me, half veiled in a silvery mist. This village was the
world to me, and an eager wish to see what it was like,
mingled with a conviction that there I should find the child.</p>

<p class='c014'>I drew near the village, looking eagerly on each side for the
object of my wanderings. The church which, afar off, seemed
in the very heart of the place, stood some distance from the
large cluster of houses, and I reached this first. It was one of
those low stone buildings so common in England, with deep
gothic windows, and a single tower draped and overrun with
ivy. Behind it was a grave-yard, crowded thick with yew and
cypress trees, under whose shadows the curious old grave-stones
gleamed dimly, as if through the mournful mistiness of a funeral
veil.</p>

<p class='c014'>Near this church, and like it, built of grey stone, to which
the ivy clung like a garment, stood a dwelling. White jessamines
and creeping roses brightened up the ivy, garlanding the
very eaves with blossoms; and a porch which was one mass of
honeysuckles, was approached by a narrow gravel path bordered
with flowers, and sheltered the front door.</p>

<p class='c014'>The contrast of life and death was strong between this
dwelling and the grave-yard. One was bright with foliage and
gay with blossoms, around which the golden bees kept up a
constant hum, and birds flitted in and out, too busy for singing,
but blending their low, pleasant chirps with the sleepy bee
music. The sunshine fell softly on bee, bird, and blossom—the
dew here and there fringed the ivy leaves with diamonds,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>and one high elm tree sweeping over all. Opposed to this was
the grave-yard, lying within the shadow of the church—the
yews and cypress crowding together among the graves like
giant mourners at a funeral, and tall trees looming above, laden
down and black with rooks’ nests, around which the sable birds
wheeled and circled in gloomy silence, broken only by an abrupt
caw, now and then, which fell upon your ear like a cry of pain
from one of the graves. Thus it was that these two buildings,
the church and parsonage house, struck me at the time. It is
strange—I have no idea what possessed me—but I turned from
the cheerful dwelling and entered the grave-yard.</p>

<p class='c014'>The long grass was heavy with dew, and my tiny boots were
soon wet to the ankles; but I wandered on among the ancient
stones, wondering what they were, and why the joy had all left
my heart so suddenly. I bent down and attempted to read the
inscriptions on these stones; but most of the letters were choked
up with moss, and of the rest I could make nothing. The
great mystery of death had never been made known to me, and
this was the first time I had ever seen a grave.</p>

<p class='c014'>I sat down on a horizontal stone of white marble, cut with
deep, black letters, and folding my hands on my lap, looked
around saddened to the heart, and in this new impression forgetting
the child I had come forth to seek. All at once, a
strain of music swept over me from the church, slow, sad, and
with a depth of solemnity that made every string in my heart
vibrate. As if a choir of angels had summoned me, I arose and
walked slowly toward the church. The door was open, and
through it swept the music in deep, thrilling gushes, that seemed
to bathe me in a solemn torrent of sound.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the dim light which filled the church I saw a group of
persons. Some had handkerchiefs to their eyes, and others bent
forward as if in prayer.</p>

<p class='c014'>Directly in front of what I afterwards learned to be the altar,
stood an object that filled me with inexpressible awe. A
quantity of black velvet fell over it in deep, gloomy folds, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>those nearest it wept bitterly, and with heavy sobs that made
my heart swell.</p>

<p class='c014'>At last the music was hushed. A man stepped down from
the altar in long, sweeping robes, whose heavy blackness was
relieved by a wave of white, sweeping over one shoulder and
across his bosom. Some one lifted the mass of velvet, and I
saw the flash of silver nails with the gleam of white satin as a
lid was flung back.</p>

<p class='c014'>Then all faded from my sight. I saw nothing but a tall man,
also in robes that swept the floor, holding a child by the hand.</p>

<p class='c014'>I uttered a low cry and moved forward. It was the child I
had seen at the spring, but oh, how changed! Her lovely face
was bathed in tears; that poor little mouth quivered with the
sobs that she was striving to keep back. One dimpled hand
was pressed to her eyes and dripping with tears—the blue ribbons,
the pretty white frock, all were laid away; and, in their
place, I saw the black sleeve of her mourning dress looped from
the white shoulders with knots of crape.</p>

<p class='c014'>I could not understand the meaning of all this, but my heart
was full of her grief. Intent on her alone, I walked up the aisle,
and, flinging my arms around her, began to weep aloud.</p>

<p class='c014'>The child felt my embrace, gave me a wild look through her
tears, and, seeing who it was, forced away the hand her father
clasped, and flung herself upon my bosom.</p>

<p class='c014'>I was about to speak.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Hush, hush!” whispered the child, in a voice that reminded
me of the waters stealing through the violet hollow, it was so
liquid with tears, “see!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Cora drew me closer to the object buried beneath those folds
of velvet, and I saw, lying upon a satin pillow fast asleep, as
I thought, the sweetest and palest face my young eyes had
ever beheld. Waves of soft, golden hair lay upon the temples,
and gleamed through the cold transparency of her cap; the
waxen hands lay folded over her still heart, pressing down a
white rose into the motionless plaits of fine linen that lay upon
her bosom.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>“Has she been long asleep?” I whispered.</p>

<p class='c014'>“She is dead!” replied the child, with a fresh burst of
tears.</p>

<p class='c014'>Dead—dead! How the word fell upon my heart, uttered
thus, with tears and shuddering, its meaning visible before me in
that marble stillness. My very ignorance gave it force and
poignancy. Its mysteriousness was terrible. I had no power
to question further, but clung to the child no longer weeping,
but hushed with awe.</p>

<p class='c014'>It must have had a singular effect, my scarlet dress and rose
colored bonnet, glowing like fire among the funeral vestments
around me. But no one attempted to separate me from the
child; and when the coffin was lifted, and the music once more
swelled through the sacred edifice, we went forth clinging to
each other. Though one of her hands was clasped in that of
her father, I felt quite sure he was unconscious of my presence,
for as they closed the coffin I could feel the shudder that ran
through his frame, even though I touched the child only. He
walked from the church like a blind man, capable of observing
nothing but the black cloud that passed on before, sweeping
his heart away with it.</p>

<p class='c014'>We entered the church-yard, and there, beneath one of the
tall trees, was a newly dug grave. I had seen it before, but
it had no significance then; now my heart stood still as we
gathered around it.</p>

<p class='c014'>The trembling, that had shaken the child’s frame ceased.
We both stood breathless and still as marble while the service
was read; but when they lowered the coffin into the grave, I
felt the pang that shot through her in every nerve of my own
frame. She uttered no sound, but my arm was chilled by the
coldness that crept over her neck and shoulders. I do not
know how the crowd left us, but we stood alone by the grave
with its fresh disjointed sods, and the brown earth gleaming
desolately through the crevices.</p>

<p class='c014'>All efforts at self-restraint gave way now that the widower
found himself alone, for in our grief children are looked upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>like flowers. Their sympathy is like a perfume; their innocence
soothes the anguish they witness. Their little souls are brimful
of beautiful charity, and their presence a foretaste of the
heaven to which the Saviour likens them.</p>

<p class='c014'>He stood in his silent grief, every nerve relaxed, every
breath a sigh; his figure drooped, and the child’s hand fell
loosely from his clasp. He leaned against the tree that was to
overshadow the beloved one forever, and gazed down upon the
grave as if his own soul were buried among the sods, and he
were waiting patiently for the angels to come and help him
search for it.</p>

<p class='c014'>I felt that Cora was growing colder and colder. Her face
was white as newly fallen snow. She ceased to weep, and
allowed me to lead her away to the marble slab I had occupied
when the funereal music led me to her.</p>

<p class='c014'>We sat down together, and she leaned against my shoulder
in profound silence. Her eyelids closed languidly, and the
violet of her eyes tinged their whiteness like a shadow. For
some minutes we sat thus, when a hoarse caw from the rooks
circling above the tree, at whose foot lay the grave, made her
start. She gave a single glance toward the tree, saw her
father and the green sods, and, bursting into a fresh agony of
tears, cried out,</p>

<p class='c014'>“She is there—she is there—mother, mother—I have no
mother!”</p>

<p class='c014'>This cry awoke a strange pang in my bosom. For the first
time there was entire sisterhood in our grief. Mother, mother,
that was the thing for which I had pined, that was my own
great want—I had felt it in the meadow when the lark fed its
young—I had felt it in my convalescence—in the picture gallery—everywhere,
and now this harassing want was hers
also. As she cried aloud for her mother, so did my soul echo
it; and, as if her own lips had uttered the sound, I wailed forth,</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mother, mother—<em>I</em> have no mother!”</p>

<p class='c014'>With that we flung our arms around each other, as flowers
sometimes twine their stems in the dark, and were silent again.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>But this intense excitement could not last with children so
impulsive and so ardent. After a while Cora began to be impatient
of her father’s immovability; it frightened her.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Let us go to him,” she whispered; “he seems dropping
to sleep as she did. How white and still his hands look, falling
so loosely against the black robe.”</p>

<p class='c014'>We crept toward the stricken man, and stood beside him in
breathless awe. He did not observe us; his eyes riveted themselves
upon the sods; the drooping of his limbs increased. He
seemed about to seat himself on the earth.</p>

<p class='c014'>Cora took his nerveless hand between hers, and raised her
great blue eyes, now full of a light more touching than tears,
to his face.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Papa, papa, come home; you told me that she would
never wake up again.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He turned his heavy eyes upon the child with a look of questioning
weariness, as if he had not comprehended her, and
remained gazing in her face, with a mournful smile parting his
lips.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Come!” said the child, pulling gently at his hand—“come!”</p>

<p class='c014'>He yielded to her infant force as if he were himself a child to
be thus guided, and walked with a feeble step toward the
house. But its cheerfulness mocked him. Bees that had been
gathering stores from the honeysuckle porch—birds lodged in
the great elm, and a thousand summer insects that love the
sunshine, all set up a clamor of melody that made him shrink as
if some violence had been offered. He said nothing, but I
could see the color fade like mist from his lips. We had
brought him too suddenly from the shadows of the grave; the
soul requires time before it can leave the vale of tears to stand
uncovered in the sunshine. We entered a little parlor, very
simple in its adornments, but neat and cheerful as a room could
be. The casements were draped with foliage, and this gave
a soft twilight to the apartment, that soothed us all.</p>

<p class='c014'>He sat down in a large, easy-chair, draped with white
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>dimity, that gave a strong contrast to his black robe. Cora
climbed to his knee, and put up her quivering lips for a kiss;
but he did not heed the action, and I saw her pretty eyes
fill with tears—she, poor thing, who had shed so many that
day.</p>

<p class='c014'>I could not bear that look of sorrow, and pressed close up to
his other knee.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Sir, papa,” for she had called him this; and why should
not any other child? “Papa, Cora wants to kiss you; she
has been trying and trying, but you don’t mind in the least.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He looked at me with a bewildered stare, glancing down
from my face to the brilliant garments that contrasted like
flame against his black robe.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is Cora, poor little Cora, you should speak to—not me,”
I said. “Look, her eyes are full again, and she has cried herself
almost to death before.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He looked at the child. The hard gloom melted from his
eyes, and drawing her to his bosom he dissolved into tears.</p>

<p class='c014'>I took his hand and kissed it. I pressed my lips down on the
child’s feet, and smoothed her mourning frock with my hands.
Tears were flashing like hail-stones down my own cheeks, and
yet there was joy in my heart. Though a child, I knew that
the worst part of his grief had passed away. Poor little Cora,
how she clung and wept, and nestled in his bosom! His strange
coldness had seemed like a second death to the child. I felt
that both were happier, and looked on with a glow of the
heart.</p>

<p class='c014'>“My child—my poor, poor orphan,” he murmured, kissing
her forehead, while one little pale cheek was pressed to his
bosom—“my orphan, my orphan”——</p>

<p class='c014'>“What is an orphan, papa?” questioned the child, lifting up
her face, and gazing at him through her tears. “What is an
orphan?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is a child who has no mother, Cora,” was the low and
mournful reply.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>My heart listened, and I felt to its innermost fold that there
was a mysterious sisterhood between the child and myself.</p>

<p class='c014'>Cora had withdrawn from her father’s bosom, and sat upright
on his knee listening to him. There was a moment’s silence,
and then, for the first time, he seemed perfectly conscious of my
presence.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And who is this?” he inquired, laying his hand on my head
with mournful kindness.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am an orphan like her,” was my answer.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Poor child!” he murmured, gently smoothing my hair
again. “But how came you here? You have been crying
too—what has grieved you?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“They were crying, all except you,” I answered. “I was
looking for her, down at the brook spring; something told me
to walk on—on—on till I came here. I saw Cora and that
beautiful lady on the satin pillow, with all the black velvet
lying so heavily over her. Cora was very unhappy; so was I;
that is all.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But who are you? What is your name?” he asked, looking
tenderly in my face.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Zana is my name?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Zana, what more? You have another name!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No—Zana, that is all.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But who is your father?”</p>

<p class='c014'>The question puzzled me; I did not know its meaning; no
one had ever asked after my father before.</p>

<p class='c014'>“My father!” I said, doubtfully.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, your father; is he living?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I don’t know!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But his name, what was that?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I don’t know!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then you are indeed an orphan, poor thing.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I have no mother; isn’t that an orphan?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Truly it is, poor infant—but where do you live?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“On the Rock, by the little spring pond; don’t you remember,
papa?” said Cora, beginning to brighten up.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>“Yes, I remember,” he replied, sinking back into the sorrowful
gloom, from which my strange appearance had aroused him;
“and this was the child then who made your pretty violet
wreath?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mamma smiled, don’t you remember, when she saw me with
it on, and said it was so lovely!” answered the child, with animation.</p>

<p class='c014'>“She never looked on you, my poor darling, without a
smile,” answered the father, so sadly that my heart swelled
once more.</p>

<p class='c014'>He seemed to forget me again, and sat gazing wistfully on
the floor. Cora, too, was exhausted by excess of weeping, and
I saw that her beautiful eyelids were drooping like the overripe
leaves of a white rose. With a feeling that it was kind
and right, I stole from the room and made my way home. It
was a long walk, and I reached the cottage in a terrible state
of exhaustion. My kind-hearted bonne took me in her arms
without annoying questions, and I sighed myself to sleep on her
bosom.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXVIII.<br> <span class='large'>PLEASANT DAYS AND PLEASANT TEACHINGS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The next morning Turner called, and I told him my mournful
adventure. He seemed greatly interested, and, after listening
very attentively, sunk into a train of thought, still holding me
on his knee. At last he addressed Maria,</p>

<p class='c014'>“This may prove a good thing for the child,” he said. “It
is strange we never thought of it before. The curate’s daughter
is just the companion for Zana, and as they teach her at
home it is possible—but we will think more of it.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>Turner placed me on the floor as he spoke, and, taking
Maria on one side, conversed with her for some time. Meanwhile
I was eager to reach the parsonage once more—I felt that
Cora would be expecting me—that I might even be wanted by
the broken-hearted man, whose grief had filled my whole being
with sympathy.</p>

<p class='c014'>I ran up stairs, put on my bonnet and little black silk mantilla
with its rich garniture of lace, and pulling Turner by the
coat, gave him and Maria a hasty good morning.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Wait,” said the kind old fellow, seizing my hand—“wait a
bit, and I will go with you. All that I dread,” he continued,
turning to Maria, “is the questions that he will naturally ask.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, but you can evade them,” answered Maria.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, by telling all that I absolutely know, nothing more
nor less, and that every servant at Greenhurst can confirm;
I must stick to simple facts, no conjectures nor convictions
without proof; no man has a right to ask them.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I had gathered a basket of fruit that morning before the dew
was off, and buried the glowing treasure beneath a quantity of
jessamine and daphna blossoms, for some intuition told me that
pure white flowers were most fitted for the house of mourning.
With this precious little basket on my arm, I waited impatiently
for Turner to start, if he was indeed going with me. But there
were hesitation and reluctance in his manner, though at last he
yielded to my importunity, and we set out.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was a pleasant walk, and my enjoyment of its beauty was
perfect. I had an object, something to fix my heart upon; the
dreamy portion of my life was over; I began to know myself
as a thinking, acting being.</p>

<p class='c014'>We entered the parsonage. Mr. Clarke was in the parlor,
sitting in the easy-chair exactly as I had left him the day before,
with his silk robe on—and his eyes, heavy with grief, were bent
upon the floor. Emboldened by the affection which had sprung
up in my heart for this lone man, I went up to him as his own
child might have done, and kissed the hand which fell languidly
by his side.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>He did not lift his eyes, but resting his hand on my head,
whispered softly,</p>

<p class='c014'>“Bless thee—bless thee, my poor orphan.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He evidently mistook me for his own child.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is not little Cora, only me,” I said—“me and Mr. Turner.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He looked up, saw Turner standing near the door, shook his
head sadly, and dropped into the old position.</p>

<p class='c014'>I swept the white blossoms, to one end of my basket and exposed
the cherries underneath, red and glowing as if the sunshine
that had ripened them were breaking back to the surface
again.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I picked them for you my ownself,” I said, holding up the
basket—“for you and Cora.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Poor man, his lips were white and parched; it is probable
he had not tasted food all the previous day! With a patient,
thoughtful smile he took a cluster of the cherries, and my heart
rose as I saw how much the grateful fruit refreshed him.</p>

<p class='c014'>“This is a strange little creature,” he said at last, addressing
Turner. “She was with us yesterday; it seemed as if God
had sent one of his cherubs. Truly of such is the kingdom of
heaven!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Dear old Turner, how his face began to work.</p>

<p class='c014'>“She is a good girl—a very good girl. We’ve done all we
could to spoil her like two old fools, her bonne and I; but
somehow she’s too much for us; as for the spoiling, it isn’t to
be done.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I saw Cora through an open door, and laying a double handful
of the cherries on her father’s robe, ran toward her. She
looked pale, poor thing, and her sweet eyes were dull and heavy.
She was in a little room that opened to the parlor, and, still in
her long linen night-gown, and with her golden curls breaking
from a tiny muslin cap, lay upon the cushions of a chintz sofa;
for, it seems, she had refused to be taken entirely from her
father, and he had spent his night in the easy-chair.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Her head was aching terribly,” she said; “she had been
awake some time, but papa was so still that it frightened her.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>She was afraid that he had gone to sleep like her mother, and
never would wake up again.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The quick sympathies of girlhood soon rendered us both more
cheerful. She began to smile when her father’s voice reached
us, and refreshed her sweet lips with my cherries, in childish
forgetfulness of the sorrow that had rendered them so pale.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’m so glad you have come,” she said, leaving the sofa; and
gathering up her night-gown till both rosy little feet were exposed
upon the matting, she ran to a side door and looked out,
calling, “Sarah Blake—Sarah Blake!”</p>

<p class='c014'>A servant girl, plump and hearty, with little grey eyes, and
cheeks red as the cherries in my basket, answered the summons.
She looked upon me with apparent curiosity and evident kindness,
and taking Cora in her arms, said, “so this is the strange
little lady.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Isn’t she nice?” whispered Cora. “Isn’t she like a star?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, she is a nice playmate; I’m glad you’ve found her,
Miss Cora, only one would like to know just who she is.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I sat down on the matting, as the door closed after them,
and taking up the white flowers, began to weave them into a
crown. It was an irresistible habit, that of sorting and combining
any flowers that came within my reach. I often did this
unconsciously, and with a sort of affectionate carefulness, for
the rude handling of a blossom gave me pain. It seemed to
me impossible that they did not suffer as a child might; so,
with a light touch, I wove my garland thick and heavy with
leaves and blossoms. I never felt lonely when flowers were my
companions. They seemed to me like a beautiful alphabet
which God had given, that I might fashion out with them the
mystic language of my own heart.</p>

<p class='c014'>The voices of Turner and the curate reached me from the
next room. They were conversing in a low tone, but I could
hear that the stricken man was shaking off the apathy of his
grief. There was interest and depth in his tone. As they
talked, the door, which had been but half on the latch, swung
open a little, and I heard him say,</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>“It is a strange and touching history. Have you made any
effort to learn how she came in this forlorn condition?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Every effort that a human being could make.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And you have literally no information beyond the morning
when you took her from the door-step?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“None whatever.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Cannot she herself remember enough to give some clue?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Illness must have driven everything from her memory.
The mere effort to recollect seems to shake her very existence.
I will never attempt it again.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“She <em>must</em> be of good birth,” said the curate, thoughtfully,
“never did human face give more beautiful evidence of gentle
blood.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I never doubted that,” answered Turner, quickly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Strange, very strange,” murmured the curate.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Is there any hope that you will aid us, sir?” said Turner,
who used few words at any time, and evidently found the
prolonged deliberations of the curate annoying.</p>

<p class='c014'>“How can you ask?” replied the curate, gently. “I thought
that was settled long ago. Were she the poorest vagrant that
ever craved alms, I would do my best to aid her. As it is, can
I ever forget yesterday? Mr. Turner, we sometimes <em>do</em> find
angels in our path. This one we shall not entertain unawares,
I know that she will prove a blessing to this desolated house.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I dropped the flowers in my lap, and began to listen breathlessly.
His beautiful faith in my future—his solemn trust in
the good that was in me, fell like an inspiration upon my soul.
From that hour my devotion to that good man and his daughter
was a religious obligation—yes, a religious obligation before
I knew what religion meant.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Ah! if <em>she</em> had only been near to help us,” said the curate,
and his eyes filled with those quiet, dewy tears with which God
first waters a grief-stricken heart before he lets in the sunshine
to which it has become unused—tears and sunshine that sometimes
freshen the soul again with more than the brightness of
childhood.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>A strange thought came over me. I laid down the wreath
and glided softly to the curate’s chair.</p>

<p class='c014'>“They told us yesterday that she had gone to God,” I
whispered, looking in his face with a sort of holy courage.
“Is God so far off that she cannot help us?”</p>

<p class='c014'>The curate gazed at me with a strange expression at first,
then a beautiful smile parted his lips, and laying both hands
on my head, he looked in my face still smiling, while his eyes
slowly filled.</p>

<p class='c014'>That moment little Cora came in. Her father reached forth
his hand and drew her arm around my neck.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Little children, love one another,” he said, and falling back
in his chair, with the smile still upon his lips, he closed his
eyes, but great tears forced themselves from under the lids and
rolled slowly downward.</p>

<p class='c014'>I drew back with the child, and with our arms interlinked
we glided into the next room. I took up my crown of white
blossoms, and, as if she read the thought in my bosom, Cora
whispered, “Mamma, is it for her?” We stole through the
parlor again, and went out. The curate sat with his eyes
closed, and Turner had an elbow on each knee, with both hands
supporting his forehead.</p>

<p class='c014'>Without speaking a word, Cora and I turned an angle of the
church and entered the grave-yard. It looked more cheerful
than it had appeared the day before. Long glances of sunshine
shot across it, and some stray birds had lost themselves in the
cypress trees, and seemed trying to sing their way out.</p>

<p class='c014'>We laid our garland down upon the bleak, new grave of
Cora’s mother, just over the spot where we knew her cold heart
was sleeping. Its faint perfume spread like an angel’s breath
all over the grave, and we went softly away, feeling that she
knew what we had done.</p>

<p class='c014'>From that day my life was divided between the parsonage
and the only home I had ever known. Turner had proved a
more efficient consoler of the curate than a thousand sermons
could have been. In the hour of his deepest grief, he had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>opened a new channel for his affections as new means of usefulness.
The overpowering anguish, that had almost swept him
from the earth in twenty-four hours, never returned again. He
would often say, looking upon us children with a peaceful smile,</p>

<p class='c014'>“She is with God, and He is everywhere.”</p>

<p class='c014'>None but a good man could have been so easily won from
such a grief by the simple power to aid others, for his wife had
been the most devoted and loving creature that the sun ever
shone upon, and her death was sudden as the flash of lightning
that darts from a summer cloud. A disease of the heart, insidious
and unsuspected till the moment of her death, left her
lifeless, in the morning, upon the pillow to which she had
retired at night with trusting prayers and innocent smiles.</p>

<p class='c014'>Thus I became the pupil of Mr. Clarke—the sister, nay,
more than the sister of his child; and now, heart and mind, my
whole nature began to expand. My profound ignorance of life
was slowly enlightened. The history of my native land was no
longer a sealed book. I began to comprehend the distinctions
that existed in society—the principles of government, the
glorious advantages which follow each step that nations take
toward freedom. I confess it took me a long time to comprehend
why one man should, without effort of his own, possess
lands which stretched from horizon to horizon, like Lord Clare,
while others, who toiled from sun to sun, could scarce secure
the necessaries of existence; nor have I yet solved the question
satisfactorily to my sense of right.</p>

<p class='c014'>No life can be really monotonous in which taste is gratified
and knowledge acquired; certainly not where the heart is
allowed to put forth its natural affections and weave them
around worthy objects.</p>

<p class='c014'>Cora and I took our lessons together, but she had little of
that eager thirst for knowledge which possessed me. Gentle,
caressing and indolent, to escape her lessons was a relief, while
I devoured mine, and found time for the gratification of a
thousand fancies that she was ready to praise, but unwilling to
share.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>It is said that women of opposite natures are most likely to
find sympathy with each other. I do not believe this, either in
men or women. In order to perfect companionship, tastes,
habits, intellectual aspirations, nay, even physical health must
assimilate.</p>

<p class='c014'>I believe no human being ever loved another more thoroughly
than I loved Cora Clarke. To say that I would have given my
life to save hers would be little, for life is not always the
greatest sacrifice one human soul can make to another. But I
would have yielded up any one of the great hopes of my existence,
could the sacrifice have secured her happiness. But in
less than three years I had outgrown Cora’s companionship.
My love, though unbounded, had a sense of protection in it. It
was the caressing attachment of a mother for her child, or an
elder sister for her orphan charge.</p>

<p class='c014'>Strange as it may seem, the companionship so essential to
my character was found more thoroughly in the father than
the child. He never wearied of teaching, and I never remember
to have become tired of learning. My appreciation of all
his arguments—and they were vast—was perfect. My love for
him was more than that of a daughter for her parent.</p>

<p class='c014'>From the time I first entered his house, I felt a conviction
that, in some way, the love that I bore for these two persons
would be brought into powerful action—that I should be called
upon to support them in great troubles, and that my own
destiny was in some mystical way bound up in them. Thus
time passed happily enough, till I reached my eleventh year.
Lord Clare was still abroad in the far east, it was said, and
I had begun to think of him as one dwells upon the characters
in a history. The name had become familiar now, and I
ceased to feel any extraordinary interest in it such as had first
impressed me.</p>

<p class='c014'>Certainly I knew something of his history. Mr. Clarke had
told me of the sudden and singular death which had overtaken
Lady Clare on the night of her marriage, and of the great
probability that the earl would never marry again, in which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>case his sister, and through her his nephew, the Etonian,
would come in possession of the title and several large estates
entailed with it.</p>

<p class='c014'>One thing, I remember, interested me a good deal, for I was
at the time informing myself regarding the hereditary privileges
of the British nobility, and it was fixed upon my memory
that this particular title, and its estates, descended alike to
male or female heirs, as they happened to fall in succession,
while a large property, acquired by Lord Clare’s marriage,
might be disposed of by deed or will.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXIX.<br> <span class='large'>MY STRANGE ACQUAINTANCE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>I still possessed Jupiter, my beautiful black pony, and
frequently rode him to the parsonage, taking a canter over the
park before returning home. Greenhurst remained unoccupied,
except by a servant or two, and my freedom in this respect
was unchecked, because Turner supposed it to be without
danger of any kind.</p>

<p class='c014'>One day—I think this was a month after I entered upon my
twelfth year—I took a fine free gallop toward a portion of
the park which has been mentioned as commanding a view of
Marston Court.</p>

<p class='c014'>I checked my pony on a ridge of upland, and was looking
toward this house which, from the first, had contained a mysterious
interest to me, when a man came suddenly from behind
a clump of trees at my right, and walking up to Jupiter, threw
his arm over the animal’s neck.</p>

<p class='c014'>I was not terrified, but this abrupt movement filled me with
surprise, and, without speaking a word, I bent my gaze searchingly
on his face and figure.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>He was a man of middle age, spare and muscular, of swarthy
complexion, and with eyes so black and burning in their glance,
that mine sunk under them as if they had come in sudden contact
with fire.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What is your name?” he said, still keeping those fierce
eyes on my face.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Take your arm off Jupiter’s neck,” I answered, “he is not
used to strangers.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He laughed, revealing a row of firm, white teeth, that gave
a ferocious expression to his whole countenance.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am almost answered,” he said, with a low chuckle, “the
blood spoke out there!”</p>

<p class='c014'>His language was broken, and his appearance strange. I
was sure that he came from foreign parts, and looked at him
with curiosity unmixed with fear.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Take your arm away,” I repeated, angrily, “you shall not
hurt my horse!”</p>

<p class='c014'>He removed his arm with another laugh, and then said, in a
tone that gave me a sensation nearer affright than I had yet
known—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, my little queen, I have taken my arm away; now
tell me your name.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why do you wish to know it?” I demanded.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Perhaps I have a reason—perhaps not—only tell me, if it
is no secret.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“My name is Zana,” I answered, reddening, for somehow the
subject had become painful to me.</p>

<p class='c014'>“In England, people have two names,” he replied.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But I have only one.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And that is Zana—nothing more, ha?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I have told you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“That should be enough,” he muttered, “but it is well to
be certain. Where do you live?” he added.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Down yonder,” I replied, pointing with my whip in the
direction of my home.</p>

<p class='c014'>“In a stone house, cut up with galleries, notched with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>balconies, buried in trees and smothered in flowers?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='c014'>“That is my home,” I replied, astonished at the accuracy
of his description.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And how long have you lived there?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I do not know why you ask, but it is no secret. I have
lived there six years.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“That is, since about the time that Lady Clare died,” he
observed, as if making a calculation.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I believe it is,” was my answer.</p>

<p class='c014'>He hesitated a moment, and then said, in a courteous
voice,</p>

<p class='c014'>“Who is your father?”</p>

<p class='c014'>I had learned to blush at my incapacity to answer this question,
and when it was thus abruptly put, the temper burned in
my cheek. Rising up haughtily in my stirrup, I gave the
bridle an abrupt pull, and poor Jupiter a lash that set him off
like an arrow. He almost knocked the man down. I looked
back to learn if he was harmed. He called after me in a language
that I had never heard spoken before, at least that I
could remember, but I understood it. The man was showering
curses upon me or my horse.</p>

<p class='c014'>After the appearance of this singular man, the monotony of
my life broke up. I became restless and self-centred, speaking
of his presence in the park to no one, but thinking of it with
continued wonder. Some mysterious sympathy, wild and painful,
but oh, how intense, drew me toward this strange being.
I feared, yet longed for his presence—longed to hear again that
language at once so strange and so familiar, that had fallen as
yet only in curses on my ear, but still carrying a fierce sort of
fascination with it.</p>

<p class='c014'>I rode to the portion of the park where I had seen him, again
and again, and sitting on my pony, searched every dingle and
group of trees, expecting each moment to see him start, brigand-like,
from the leafy gloom. But he did not come, and, filled with
restless disappointment, I at length sunk into the ordinary occupations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>of life, but with an unsettled feeling that had never
possessed me before.</p>

<p class='c014'>By this time I knew that some mystery was attached to my
life—that I was nameless, motherless, fatherless. In short, that
like a wild hare or a wounded bird, I had been picked up in
charity by the wayside, and in charity nurtured by that unique
Spanish woman and old Turner. I felt this keenly. As ignorance
was swept from my mind, the painful mystery that clung
around me darkened my soul with a feeling of unspeakable
desolation. I had learned what shame was, and felt it to my
heart’s core every time my want of name or connections was
alluded to. Still the entire force of this isolation, the effect it
might have upon my after life and character, could not be felt
in all its poignancy, as it was in later times. But its mistiness,
the indefinite form which every thing regarding my past history
took, made myself a subject of perpetual thought. Upon my
memory there was a constant, but unavailing strain. There
seemed to be a dark curtain in my mind, hiding all that my
soul panted to know, but which I had lost all power to lift or
disturb. Thus time wore heavily—heavily months and months—still
I saw no more of the man whose memory hung about
me like a superstition, which I had neither power nor wish to
throw off.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXX.<br> <span class='large'>THE INVOLUNTARY HUNT AND ITS CONSEQUENCES.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>At last an event arose that completely destroyed the beautiful,
but dull quietude of our lives. Lord Clare’s sister arrived
unexpectedly at Greenhurst, and a large party were to follow
her and her son down from London, to spend the shooting
season.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>This sudden invasion of the woods and grounds that had
been exclusively ours for so many years, was a source of great
annoyance to old Turner. His usual quaint good-humor was
sadly disturbed. He seemed quite beside himself with anxiety,
and nervously besought me to give up my usual rides, and
remain confined to the house if possible during the time Lady
Catherine and her son might remain at Greenhurst.</p>

<p class='c014'>This was asking much of a young creature just verging into
girlhood, and full of a strong, fresh curiosity for seeing and feeling
the life of which she began to know herself a vital part.
Besides, I was a creature of the open air. No bird ever felt a
keener necessity for the bright atmosphere, and all the rich
beauty of out-door life. Shut up in the house, I was like a
wild lark in its cage, moaning, moping, and with no hearty
relish of existence left in me. I wished to obey good old Turner.
He was so anxious on the point, and seemed so grieved
at the idea of depriving me of a single pleasure, that had the
thing been possible, I would have kept myself a prisoner for
weeks rather than increase his unaccountable perturbation.</p>

<p class='c014'>But he was seldom with us now, that kind, strange man, and
my confinement became terrible—when would it end? How
long was I, who had never been confined in-doors a whole day
in my life, unless in that one fever—how was I to endure weeks
and weeks of this dull imprisonment?</p>

<p class='c014'>It was too much. Not even to please Turner could I submit
to this longer.</p>

<p class='c014'>One day, I think it was the fourth, my restless spirit broke
bounds. I took an opportunity when Maria was occupied, to
steal out into the open air. Jupiter’s stable, a pretty building
that might have passed for a summer-house, stood a little back
from the kitchen garden, and I heard him neighing sharply, as
if he, like his mistress, were beginning to rebel.</p>

<p class='c014'>For some reason, I never knew what, except that Turner
disliked to have servants about our place, the old man had
always taken care of Jupiter with his own hands. With so
few objects of love, I naturally often followed him to the pretty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>building where Jupiter was stalled, more like a fairy courser
than the matchless pony he was.</p>

<p class='c014'>The pleasant neigh which the animal set up as I approached,
awoke all the wild-wood spirit that Turner’s interdict had kept
down in my bosom so long. I ran to the stable, dragged the
side-saddle with its pretty embroidered trappings from its
closet, and girded it breathlessly upon Jupiter’s back. The
creature seemed eager as myself to be upon the hill-side. His
ears quivered with delight; he rubbed his head against my
shoulder with a mellow whimper, and opened his mouth for the
bit the moment he saw the embossed bridle in my hand.</p>

<p class='c014'>Patting him on the back with a promise of speedy return, I
entered the house, ran up to my room, and hurried on my habit,
of soft green cloth, and the beaver hat with a long black ostrich
plume that floated from one side.</p>

<p class='c014'>The blood was hot in my cheek as I tied the hat on. Without
staying to twist up the curls that floated away with the
feather in picturesque confusion, I ran off to the stables, huddling
up the skirt of my riding-dress with both hands.</p>

<p class='c014'>I knew that it was wrong—that I should be sorry enough
for it before night, but in my willfulness this only gave a keener
zest to the enjoyment I proposed to myself.</p>

<p class='c014'>Away we went, Jupiter and I, dashing through the trees,
over the velvet sward, and across the broad avenues, along
which the morning sunshine lay in rivers of light. The branches
rained down their ripe brown and golden leaves on me as I
passed; and a crisp white frost that lay like quicksilver among
the grass, gave forth a rasping sound more exhilarating than
music, as Jupiter’s feet flew over it. The air was clear and
bright, with mingled frost and sunshine as it fell upon my face
and swept my garments. The blood kindled like wine in my
veins. I was wild with the joyousness of free motion, ready
for leaping a ditch, flying through the air—any thing wild or
daring that had life and quick motion in it.</p>

<p class='c014'>Away we went toward the uplands, from which a view of
Marston Court could be obtained. I thought of the strange
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>man who had surprised me on that spot as we rushed along—laughed
aloud as I remembered how Jupiter and I had baffled
him once, how ready we were to do it again. I longed to see
him, not for any specified purpose. Nothing then was important
enough to have kept me motionless a moment. But abroad
as I was, with a wild thirst for adventure of any kind, it would
have been something like the excitement I wanted, could the
mysterious language with which he cursed me have threatened
us with danger once more.</p>

<p class='c014'>But though I searched for this being, riding around and over
the eminence on which he had appeared but once, nothing but
the cool, beautiful solitude rewarded me. The luxurious stretch
of country between me and Marston Court, brown, hazy, and
many-tinted, with the picturesque old building looming up
through the rich shadows—all its clear outlines drowned in soft
autumnal colors—all its hoariness and age mellowed down and
lost in the dreamy distance—this rare view, with the upland
on which we stood, was wrapped in quiet. Not a human being
was in sight.</p>

<p class='c014'>A strange desire seized me to visit this building, which had
so often charmed me with its loneliness and beauty. It was
some miles distant. I knew that, but Jupiter had merely tried
his strength as yet, simply breathed himself in our progress to
the uplands. He had been shut up in the stable for days, and
seemed as wild for action as his mistress.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Shall we try it, Jupiter?” I said, smoothing his mane with
my whip. “There is a glorious run for us, Jupiter, as we have
determined to be disobedient and naughty. Ju! suppose we
do something worth while?”</p>

<p class='c014'>At the sound of my voice, the pony began to quiver his
ears, and snuffed the air saucily, as if he knew some mischief
was afloat, and was eager for his share.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Come, then,” and I gathered up the bridle, shaking it gleefully.
Jupiter gave his head a toss, and away we went toward
Marston Court.</p>

<p class='c014'>The eminence lay behind, and we were in a thickly wooded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>little valley, moving rather slowly, for I was charmed by broken
glimpses of a small stream that flashed up from the shadows,
when the having of hounds, the tramp of horses, and a wild
confusion of sounds swept down the hollow. Before I could
tighten my reins, a stag shot by me, so close that Jupiter
reared with a wild snort, almost flinging me backward from the
saddle.</p>

<p class='c014'>The stag, a noble animal, cleared the stream with one desperate
bound, and for an instant I saw him turn his great, wild
eyes, glowing with pain and terror through the shadows.
Blood-specked foam dropped from his jaws; and his strained
limbs quivered with an agony of terror, that made me tremble
upon my saddle with sympathy.</p>

<p class='c014'>As I looked, the poor animal, whose head was beginning to
droop, gave a sudden start, flung up his antlers, and with a
desperate staggering leap disappeared up the valley. I had
not caught my breath again, when down through the opposite
gorge came a train of hounds, leaping forward with cruel
ferocity, some breast to breast, others in single file, but all with
great, savage eyes and open jaws, howling and baying out their
blood-thirsty eagerness. They rushed by me, some on one side
of Jupiter, some on the other, spotting his black coat with
flakes of foam, and making him start with the fury of their
noise.</p>

<p class='c014'>For myself, I struck at the dogs with my whip, and madly
flung it after them. My sympathy for the poor stag was a
pang of such agony that it made me wild. But they swept
away like the wind, howling back, as it seemed to me, their
brutal defiance and derision of my helplessness.</p>

<p class='c014'>Then like the rush of a tempest, heavy with thunder and red
with lightning, came the hunt. The flaming uniforms; those
dark horses; the long riding shirts, streaming back like dusky
banners; ostrich plumes flashing blackly upon the strong current
of wind created by the quick motion of their owners. All
this rushed by me, as I have said, like a sudden storm.</p>

<p class='c014'>Directly over the spot where we stood bore down the hunt,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>sweeping us away with it as a swollen stream tosses onward the
straws which it encounters.</p>

<p class='c014'>The stag was nearly run down; the hunters were becoming
tired; but Jupiter was fresh as a lark, and held his own bravely
with the most noble-blooded hunter of them all.</p>

<p class='c014'>The hounds were yelling, like fiends, ahead. Some one
called out that the stag was at bay. A huntsman, all in scarlet,
shot out from the rest onward like an arrow. Jupiter made
a sudden bound. It may be in the fierce excitement that I
urged him; but he gave a great leap, and kept neck and neck
with the huntsman.</p>

<p class='c014'>Beneath a pile of rocks that choked up one end of the valley,
the poor stag was run down. With his delicate fore hoofs
lifted up with a desperate effort at another spring, he stood
one instant with his head turned back, and his great, agonized
eyes fixed upon the dogs. The rocks were too high. His poor
limbs exhausted, he could not make the leap, but wheeled back
and desperately tossed the first hound, who fell with a yelp
upon the stones.</p>

<p class='c014'>But the whole pack was upon him, scrambling up the rocks,
and making fiercely for his throat from all points.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Save him—save him!” I shouted, striking Jupiter with my
clenched hand. “Save him—save him!”</p>

<p class='c014'>I rushed by the huntsman. Hitherto we had kept, as I have
said, neck and neck; but Jupiter felt the sting of my blow, and
gave a mad bound that brought us in the midst of the dogs. I
still urged him on, striving to trample down the fierce brutes
beneath his hoofs. The stag knew it, I do believe. The poor
animal felt that I was his friend. No human eyes ever had a
deeper agony of appeal in them. I sprang from Jupiter’s
back down among the dogs, and cast myself before their
victim.</p>

<p class='c014'>I saw the huntsman leap from his horse and plunge among
the dogs.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Move—come away, the hounds will tear you to pieces,” he
shouted, beating fiercely about with his whip.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>“They shall not kill him; call them off, I say, these beasts
shall <em>not</em> kill him,” I shrieked, in reply.</p>

<p class='c014'>“That moment a hound sprang upon me, tearing my riding-skirt,
and almost bringing me to the earth.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I cried aloud, but not with fear. The excitement was terrible,
but there was no cowardice in it.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Great heavens! she will be devoured,” I heard him say;
then he leaped like a flame upon the dog, and grappling him by
the throat, bore him backward to the earth.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Now run, run!” he cried, panting with the hound in his
power.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No!” I answered stoutly, “they will tear him to pieces if
I do. Keep them off—keep them off.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He made no answer, but wrestled more fiercely with the
hound.</p>

<p class='c014'>That moment the whole hunt came up, men, keepers, and
women surrounding us in their gorgeous dresses like a battalion
of cavalry.</p>

<p class='c014'>I heard a clamor of voices, the shrieks of women, the excited
shouts of huntsmen giving orders. Keepers rushed in
among the hounds with their clubs. In a few moments the
dogs were driven back crouching and snarling among their
masters. I stood alone by the poor stag, with a host of eyes
upon me; then, for the first time, I began to tremble.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Here,” said a stout old squire, whose white hair fell like
snow from under the close hunting cap, “here, George Irving,
you have won the right to cut his throat. Thomas, where is
the knife?”</p>

<p class='c014'>A keeper came forward, presenting a sharp hunting-knife.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You will not—you will <em>not</em>,” I said, clasping my hands, and
standing face to face with the youth who had saved me. I felt
that my lips were quivering, and that great tears were dropping
like hail-stones down my burning cheeks—“you will not.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No,” answered the youth, taking the knife and holding it
toward me. “It is not mine, this brave child was in first. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>found her, like the stag, at bay, braving the hounds. Tell me,
shall not the life of this animal be hers?”</p>

<p class='c014'>A loud hallo answered him, echoed by a chorus of musical
female voices.</p>

<p class='c014'>The youth reached forth his knife again, but I rejected it.
The stag was safe, and my heart so full of joy, that I felt it
breaking all over me. The noble face before me brightened as
if from the reflection of mine, and for the first time I saw that
it was a very young man who had saved me. Young and—but
I will not describe him—for upon his features at that moment
there was something of which no language can give the least
idea.</p>

<p class='c014'>I felt the blood rushing up to my face, for now all things
became clear, and I knew that a score of strange eyes were
wondering at me. The feather in my hat was broken, and fell
prone upon my shoulder; my skirt had been badly wrenched
and mangled by the dogs; their muddy foot-prints were trampled
all over it; a morbid sense of the beautiful made me
shrink with shame, as I saw all those eyes fixed upon my
dilapidated state.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Where is Jupiter?” I said, turning to my young friend.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Will you search for him, I should like to go away?”</p>

<p class='c014'>But my pony had retreated beyond the crowd, and could not
be seen. This increased my distress. I sat down upon a stone,
and looking at the exhausted stag, began to think myself the
most miserable object of the two.</p>

<p class='c014'>I heard a buzz of voices around me, and could distinguish
the words, “Who is it? She is strange to every one here.
Where can the picturesque creature have sprung from?”</p>

<p class='c014'>That moment a pang shot through my heart. Who indeed
was I? How came I there? By a gross act of disobedience
to my best friend? I felt that my face was bathed with
blushes and with tears; for the first time in my life I was
ashamed of myself.</p>

<p class='c014'>A lady rode close up to me, so close that her skirts swept my
shoulder.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>“Whose little girl are you?” she said. “You are by far
too young for a scene like this.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I looked up and knew the face. It was Lady Catherine
Irving, a little more spare, and with a host of fine wrinkles
accumulated on her haughty face, but with the same cold,
white complexion; the same self-satisfied look.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Ah, you seem to know me,” she said, settling her beaver
hat with one hand. “Now tell me your name; don’t be
afraid.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am not afraid, not in the least,” I answered. “Why
should I be?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“True enough; what a bright little wood-nymph it is,” she
continued, smiling back upon two scarlet clad gentlemen behind
her. “I suppose there really is nothing superlatively frightful
about me—ha!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Something superlatively the reverse,” answered the gentleman
thus challenged.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You hear, little wood-nymph,” she said, after appropriating
this compliment with a bend of the head, “there is nothing
to fear, so speak out. Where do you live? How came you
among all these gentlemen and ladies?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I live in the park, near Greenhurst, madam, with Mr.
Turner”——</p>

<p class='c014'>“Ha!” exclaimed Lady Catherine, with a sharp glance at
my face. “Go home, child—how came you here?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I came on my pony, madam.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But the hunt, what on earth brought you there?” cried
the lady, seeming to become more and more displeased.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The hunt—if all this company means that—came across
me, and carried Jupiter and I along.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But how came you dismounted and among the hounds?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“They were all upon the poor stag, and I could not bear it,”
I replied, simply.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mother,” said the young man walking close to the lady
and speaking in a low voice, “let us take some other time for
questioning her. Lead off the party, so many persons terrify
the poor child.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>“Mount your horse then,” she replied, sharply, “I will see
you again child. I must have some explanation of all this.
You are right, George, this is no place. Mount—mount!”</p>

<p class='c014'>The youth hesitated, looked at me, at the stag, and then
rather wistfully at his mother.</p>

<p class='c014'>“We are waiting,” she said, with an impatient wave of her
whip, and a glance at me that brought a flash of red to my
cheeks. I, in my innocence, thought that she was displeased
with the torn state of my poor dress.</p>

<p class='c014'>The youth mounted, and the hunt dispersed, breaking up
into groups and pairs, and scattering a red gleam through the
woods.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXXI.<br> <span class='large'>MY UNEXPECTED ESCORT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>I was left alone, I and the poor trembling, exhausted stag,
who lay partly upon his knees, gazing at me through his filmy
and half shut eyes.</p>

<p class='c014'>I looked around for Jupiter, but he was not to be seen—no
living thing but the worried stag and myself in all that dim
solitude.</p>

<p class='c014'>A sense of exhaustion and of loneliness fell upon me. My
heart grew mournful, and the poor stag with his stiffened limbs
and the foam dried on his lips, filled me with compassion. I
went down to the brook, brought up water in my hands, and
bathed his mouth with it. When this was done, the animal
struggled to his feet and staggered away down toward the
water, leaving me alone. I felt this total desertion keenly, and
burying my face in my lap, began to cry like the child I was.</p>

<p class='c014'>I sat full ten minutes sobbing forth the desolation of my
heart, when the quick tramp of a horse made me look up. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>thought it must be Jupiter returning to his duty, but instead of
him I saw the young huntsman riding gently through the trees,
and now close by me.</p>

<p class='c014'>I started up, ashamed of my tears, and looked resolutely
another way, hoping to escape his notice, but he sprang off
his horse and was at my side before I could dash the drops
from my burning cheek.</p>

<p class='c014'>“So you have been crying, poor child?” he said, with a sort
of patronizing manliness that would have amused an older person.
“No wonder, we were a set of savages to leave you
here alone, and with no means of getting home.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It was savage!” I said, realizing for the first time how
badly I had been used; “but the animals were just as cruel,
the stag and Jupiter; I would not have believed it of Jupiter,
he used to love me; and the very first trouble, off he goes
with the rest!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Tears came into my eyes again at this thought, but I
quenched and crushed them between my eyelashes, too proud
for an exposure of my keen distress at the desertion of Jupiter.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Nay,” said the youth, smiling, “but I have come back to
see after you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Did you?” I replied, with a gush of gratitude; “to see
after me, and for nothing else?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What else should bring me back?” he replied, looking
around as if in search of something. “So the stag has gone
too, ungrateful beast. I had a fancy to fasten some badge on
his horns that he might be safe hereafter. He was a noble old
fellow after all, no wonder he was glad to get away from this
spot!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But Jupiter,” I said, with growing confidence in the youth,
“what can have become of my pony? How am I to get home?
Oh, if I only had been good—if I had but stayed in-doors as
they told me!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“As who told you, lady bird?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mr. Turner. He knew that I had no business abroad
when the country was full of strangers!”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>“And is Turner a relative? What control can he possess
over you?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“He,” I replied, kindling with wonder that any one should
doubt Turner’s right to control me. “Mr. Turner, I belong
to him! No one else owns me. Scarcely any one else cares
for me. Why, in the wide, wide world, he is the only person
who ever shall control me—dear, blessed Mr. Turner!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“He is a whole-hearted, queer old soul, sure enough,” was
the reply; “but certainly you are not his child; I never knew
that he was married.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“His child!” I cried, breathless with the thought. “I—I
don’t know—how should I? I his child—his own? What
put the idea into any one’s head? It sounds so strange. Do
you mean that Mr. Turner is my father that people ask after
so often?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Nay, I mean nothing—only is Mr. Turner, as you call him,
married?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, I think not. Maria, I am sure, isn’t married; but I
never asked, never thought of it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He was about to answer, but that instant a low, timid neigh
from behind the spur of a rock close by, made me start.</p>

<p class='c014'>“That is Jupiter—that is Jupiter!” I exclaimed, and with
this joyful shout away I bounded, gathering up my torn skirt
in both arms, and full of spirit once more.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sure enough there stood my pony, sheltered and hidden by
the rock, to which the pretty creature had fled from the crowd
of huntsmen. The sound of my voice called forth his neigh, and
never did a dumb creature express more satisfaction at the
presence of its mistress.</p>

<p class='c014'>“There you see—you see it was not Jupiter’s fault, the dear,
dear old rogue. He was so wise to creep away and wait till
those hateful people were all gone!” I exclaimed triumphantly,
laying my hot cheek against the glossy neck of my horse.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And did all those people really seem so hateful?” replied
the youth, caressing Jupiter.</p>

<p class='c014'>“All! I don’t know. That lady was the only one I saw
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>distinctly. The rest floated around me, surging up and down
like a red cloud. But I shall never forget her!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And did she fill you with repulsion?—was she the hateful
one?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I had seen her before; I knew her!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Indeed—where?” said the youth, in a displeased manner.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I would rather not say—it is unpleasant to talk about,” I
answered, greatly annoyed.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But it is years since my—that is Lady Catherine, has been
at Greenhurst,” he answered, thoughtfully. “Never, I think,
since the very sudden death of Lady Clare. You must have
mistaken her for some other person.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I was greatly excited. The remembrance of that heartless
voice, when I was taken into Greenhurst, so helpless, stung me.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No—no,” I answered, “there are some things one never
forgets, never mistakes. I have seen that face in my dreams,
and hated it in my thoughts too long for any hope of that!”</p>

<p class='c014'>The youth drew himself back, and ceased to caress my horse.
There was a quiet dignity in his manner that made me ashamed
of my own vehemence.</p>

<p class='c014'>“That lady is my mother!” he said calmly, but with a tone
of cold reproof in his voice.</p>

<p class='c014'>I scanned his face with a keen wish to disbelieve him. But
now that he was angry, there was a resemblance between his
features and those I did in truth hate.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am sorry for it,” I said, with a nervous sob—“very,
very!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Sorry for what, that she is my mother—or that you have
spoken disrespectfully of her?” he questioned, more gently than
before.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am sorry for everything that has happened to-day, and
for my own part in it most of all. It began in wicked disobedience,
and will end—oh, how will it end? What will Mr.
Turner think of me when he knows this?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why, what great sin are you crying for?” he said, smiling
once more. “Certainly you are a very free-spoken little person;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>but we must not let Turner quite kill you; so don’t be
afraid!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“He kill me? What, Turner? No—no, not that. Afraid,
afraid? Yes, yes, I am afraid, for I have done wrong. Oh,
what will become of me? I never was afraid before—never,
never.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But what have you done?” he asked, still more kindly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mr. Turner forbade me leaving the house. He told me
how wrong it was when Lady Catherine’s company might come
across me at any time; he tried—oh, so much—to keep me
happy in-doors; but it was of no use, I could not endure it.
It was as if I were a bird beating my wings against a cage.
The wickedness was in me all the time. I thought it was
nonsense staying in the house, because other people might be
abroad. Then it was so tempting, Mr. Turner at Greenhurst—my
bonne occupied—the pony neighing for me to come and
take him out. Really, after all, it seemed as if I could <em>not</em>
help it”——</p>

<p class='c014'>George Irving laughed so gleefully that I could not go on,
but began to laugh too.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And so you just broke loose and ran away?” he said,
patting Jupiter again and again.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, I stole the horse, saddled him myself, and was off like
a bird,” I replied, reassured by his laughter, and feeling the
consciousness of my disobedience borne away on his merry
tones.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And here you are, full seven miles from home, all alone but
for me, after braving a pack of hounds in full cry, afraid of old
Turner’s frown, as if he were the Grand Mogul.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He laughed again, but this light way of naming my benefactor
awoke the conscience again in my bosom.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It was very wrong—oh, that I had stayed at home!” I
exclaimed, with a fresh pang.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, well, don’t fret about it any more,” he said, with a
little impatient playfulness that made me smile again. “Let
me lift you to Jupiter’s back—a pretty pony he is, my little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>lady—and scamper home like a good child. Ten chances to
one old Turner will know nothing about it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I allowed him to lift me to the saddle, and felt myself blushing
as he arranged my torn skirts with evident anxiety to give
them a decent appearance.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Now,” he said, springing on his hunter, “I must put your
pony to his metal again. Unless I overtake Lady Catherine
before she reaches home, my position will very much resemble
yours! Come, let us start as we came, neck and neck!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No,” said I, brightening with new spirit, “I came in ahead—your
hunter fell a little behind Jupiter.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But try him now—his speed will be of use to us both,”
was the laughing reply. “My mother will be impatient, and
her anger may prove worse to bear than old Turner’s, let me
tell you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He put his horse into a quick canter, and my pony stretched
himself vigorously to keep up.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But please leave us to ourselves!” I pleaded, breathless,
with a new dread; “I do not wish to go with you to Lady
Catherine!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well—no, I am afraid her ladyship might prove formidable,
were she to be surprised after that fashion a second
time,” he replied, slightly checking his hunter, “I only propose
to see you and Jupiter safe on some avenue of the park,
where you can scamper home in safety. I must be in-doors before
Lady Catherine, or this escapade will be difficult to account for.”</p>

<p class='c014'>My cheek grew hot with mortified pride; I felt that he was
afraid of some annoyance, perhaps ashamed of having returned
for me. Without a word I drew in Jupiter with a suddenness
that made him leap—wheeled him on one side, and plunged into
the woods, leaving the gentleman, for a moment, unconscious of
my desertion.</p>

<p class='c014'>He followed directly, urging his hunter to a run, and calling
after me as he dashed through the trees. I took no heed, and
gave back no answer; the blood was burning in my temples;
I felt my lips curve and quiver with insulted pride. No man or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>boy living should speak to me, or look at me, who was ashamed
to do it before all the world. Then my heart began to ache
even in its wrath. I had thought so well of him, his interest in
my loneliness, his brave fight with the hounds—why, why did
he exert all this tender strength in my behalf to wound me so
cruelly afterward? He was by my side, but I kept my head
averted with girlish willfulness, expressing my displeasure rudely
like any other spoiled child.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Will you not tell me why you ran away?” he said, attempting
to rest one hand upon my saddle as he cantered by me.</p>

<p class='c014'>Oh, how I longed to lift my pretty riding-whip and strike him
hard across the face! I think the act would have appeased me.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Say, child, will you explain this bit of very bad manners?”
he urged, evidently determined to provoke me to some reply.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Child!” This was too much; the whole taunt stung me
into speech. I checked Jupiter, and felt the fire leap into my
face as it was turned toward my persecutor. He looked grave—offended.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Because I wish to ride alone: I’m not used to company,
and don’t want any, especially of persons who are afraid or
ashamed of being kind to me,” I said, half crying amid my fiery
vexation.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am not afraid, and am not ashamed,” he answered gravely;
“yet you cannot understand, child, for with all that fierce temper
you are but a child!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am more than twelve—thirteen, fifteen, for what any
one knows,” I said, half blinding myself with tears. “I understand
what it is just as well as you can tell me; you are afraid
of that haughty person, your mother. You are not quite satisfied
with having braved the hounds before a whole crowd of
people, for a little girl who has only Mr. Turner to care for her.
Oh, yes, I know—I could feel that without knowing!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Strange child,” he said, with a grave smile. “Who taught
you all this, so young, and without the faith becoming this girlish
beauty?”</p>

<p class='c014'>The anger was burning out in my heart. There was something
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>manly and reproving in his calm seriousness that subdued
me. He reached out his hand, while the smile brightened all
over his face.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Come, let us be friends—you cannot keep angry with me,
because I have not deserved it!”</p>

<p class='c014'>I gave him my hand. He stooped in his saddle as if to press
his lips upon it, but checked the impulse; and, holding it tight
an instant, let it drop, saying very earnestly,</p>

<p class='c014'>“I would not have wounded you for the world.”</p>

<p class='c014'>That instant the undergrowth close by us was sharply parted,
and Turner broke into the path on which we had paused.</p>

<p class='c014'>I felt the blood leave my face, and, for the first time, trembled
at the sight of my benefactor. The old man looked sternly
across me to George Irving, whom he neither saluted nor
addressed; but, taking Jupiter by the bit, said in a deep,
husky voice, that made the heart die in my bosom,</p>

<p class='c014'>“Zana, come away!”</p>

<p class='c014'>I dropped the bridle, and covering my face with both gauntleted
hands, cowered down upon my saddle with a keen sense
of the humiliation which he was witnessing.</p>

<p class='c014'>I listened breathlessly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Turner, if you will let the pony move on, I will dismount
and lead my hunter while we have a little talk.”</p>

<p class='c014'>It was Irving’s voice, and I listened breathlessly for the
reply. Some seconds passed before it came; Turner’s throat
seemed husky.</p>

<p class='c014'>“To-morrow, Mr. George, I’ll be at the Hurst,” he said,
“and then as much talk as pleases you; but now I must take
this child home.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But she seems terrified; you will not—surely you will not be
harsh with her?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Harsh with her! with Zana—was I ever harsh to you in
my life, little one?” urged the old man, and the husky voice
was broken up with tenderness.</p>

<p class='c014'>I uncovered my face, and holding out both hands to the old
man, turned toward young Irving.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>“You know how wrong I have been—see how forgiving, how
kind, how good <em>he</em> is!”</p>

<p class='c014'>The old man’s face began to work. The fine wrinkles quivered
over his cheek and around his mouth, a sure sign of emotion
in him. He lifted my two gloved hands and kissed them
fondly. All at once he dropped my hands and went up to
Irving.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mr. Irving—my dear Master George, forget that you have
seen her—forget all about it—promise me that you will.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“That would be difficult,” answered the youth, glancing at
me with a smile.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It would indeed,” said the old man, looking fondly in my
face. “God help us—this is a bad business! At any rate,
leave us now!”</p>

<p class='c014'>The young man turned, bent his head, and wheeling his hunter,
disappeared.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXXII.<br> <span class='large'>THE UNWELCOME VISITOR.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>I spent a wakeful night, disturbed by a host of new feelings
and strange thoughts, that crowded upon me like a rush of
waters. All night long a review of the day’s hunt went forward
in my fancy. The brilliant dresses and those strange faces
circled me with a sort of fascination. Sometimes they smiled
warningly, then they gibed at my torn garments—and foremost
of all was the proud face of Lady Catherine. Oh, how I began
to hate that woman! It was the bitter antagonism of a life-time
striking root deep in my heart.</p>

<p class='c014'>Toward morning I thought of Turner, with a pang that was
punishment enough for the sin of my first disobedience. I knew
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>that he was not only grieved but plunged into difficulties on
my account—that all the evils he had been so anxious to guard
against were already brought on by my obstinate self-indulgence.</p>

<p class='c014'>This reflection made me heart-sick, and I turned away from
the soft daylight as it broke through my room, ashamed to
receive it on my ungrateful face. With faltering steps I went
down stairs and seated myself in the little breakfast-room.
Turner was in the garden, but though I had not the cowardice
to shrink from encountering him in the house, I could not summon
courage to seek him.</p>

<p class='c014'>He saw me at the window looking sad enough, I dare say,
and, coming up, gave me a handful of tiny white roses, which
were the glory of a plant that he had never allowed to be
touched before. I felt the tears rushing to my eyes, and creeping
toward the old man, murmured in the deepest humility,</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, Mr. Turner, why don’t you scold me? Why not
punish my wickedness?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Because,” he answered, with a miserable shake of the head,
“because you will be punished enough, poor thing, before night,
or I am mistaken.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I hope so—I’m sure it would be a satisfaction to be soundly
reprimanded. You break my heart with all this kindness.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Here comes one,” said Turner, growing red in the face,
“who will not sin in that way, I can answer.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I followed his look, and saw Lady Catherine Irving coming
through the garden, walking rather quickly, and brushing down
the autumn flowers with the sweep of her garments. On seeing
us she resumed the stateliness usual to her movements, and
stooped now and then to gather the snowy flowers of a chrysanthemum,
which she seemed to examine curiously while
approaching the house.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Ah, Turner,” she said, drawing toward the window, “what
a pretty little nest you have here; and what flowers! I have
never seen any thing to compare with these,” and forming a
ring with the thumb and fore finger of her left hand, she drew
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>the white tufts softly through it, as Nero might have trifled on
the day of his mother’s murder. “Why, you live here with
your little family quite like fairies. No wonder you are so often
absent from Greenhurst.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I hope that none of the duties my lord left for me to perform
are neglected, madam,” answered Turner, with a degree
of dignity that charmed me.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, no—I do not complain—far from it, good Turner—that
I am here is a proof of it. Your child—I hope she was
neither frightened nor hurt by the hounds.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, madam,” I answered, leaning through the sash. “It
was rather lonesome being left by myself with the poor stag;
but the young gentleman”——</p>

<p class='c014'>“Hush!” said Turner, sternly, glancing toward Lady Catherine,
whose cheek flushed with sudden color.</p>

<p class='c014'>I saw the color and the glitter in her eyes, more expressive
still, and even Turner’s caution could not control me. I was
determined to let her know that her son had returned to protect
me. The remembrance that he had seemed to fear her
knowledge of it only urged me on.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The young gentleman came back and put Jupiter and me
into the right path: but for that I don’t know what would
have become of us.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Your daughter seems a bright, and—forgive me, good Turner—rather
forward little thing,” said the lady, lifting the
flowers softly to her lips, as she gave him a searching glance.
“I am very glad though, that she is unharmed.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Turner looked at her, and then with a restless movement at
me. The color came up among his wrinkles, and his features
began to work as if some unfinished resolution had set them in
motion. Before he could speak, however, Lady Catherine’s
voice broke in again,</p>

<p class='c014'>“And your wife—my good Turner—really I must have a
sight of her and this pretty home of yours—quite a <i><span lang="fr">bijou</span></i> in the
grounds, truly!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Placing a richly enamelled glass to her eyes, the lady took a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>quiet survey of the building before Turner could find words to
answer her.</p>

<p class='c014'>Never had I seen the old man so agitated. The color came
and went beneath his wrinkles; his thin lips grew pale and purple
by turns; his state of irresolution was painful.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I will step in and see your wife!” said Lady Catherine,
dropping her glass to the full length of its Venetian chain, and
looking around for the door.</p>

<p class='c014'>Now Turner became calm; every muscle and nerve settled
down. He stood more firmly on the ground, and looking his
tormentor steadily in the face, answered,</p>

<p class='c014'>“Some one must have been joking at my expense, my lady.
I have no wife!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No wife!” exclaimed Lady Catherine, with a start that
even I could see was premeditated. “No wife—and this
child?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You are mistaken,” said Turner, “this is not my child.
Yourself saw me when I took her up from your own door-stone,
or rather the door-stone of Greenhurst, eight years ago.”</p>

<p class='c014'>A cold smile curled Lady Catherine’s lip. She lifted her
glass again and eyed me through it. “I remember the circumstance,”
she said, and the hateful smile deepened—“I remember,
too, that a child disappeared very mysteriously but a short
time before from this nest—two children in fact—if my people
told me aright.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“They did tell you aright, lady,” said Turner, sternly—but
she interrupted him.</p>

<p class='c014'>“One, the elder, went out to service, I fancy. This one
dropped, miraculously, on my door-step. Well, well, my good
Turner, no one thinks of quarrelling with this fanciful way of
adopting your own children; but her mother—unless you are
really married to this woman, she must go. I cannot answer
it to society—to Lord Clare, the most particular man on
earth—if she is allowed to remain on the estate a day longer.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Madam,” said Turner, “I have said but the truth; Zana,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>there, is no more my daughter than her Spanish bonne is my
wife!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Who is her—her father?—who is her mother then?” asked
Lady Catherine.</p>

<p class='c014'>I remarked that her voice faltered in putting this question,
and she could not look in Turner’s face.</p>

<p class='c014'>Turner regarded her firmly, and a faint smile stirred his lip.
Lady Catherine saw it, and once more there arose a shade of
color in her cheek.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Lady, I can answer these questions no more than yourself,
for you were present when I found the poor child.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And had you never seen her before?” questioned the lady.</p>

<p class='c014'>Turner hesitated and seemed to reflect; but at last he answered
firmly enough.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is impossible for me to say yes or no.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The lady played with her flowers awhile, and then spoke
again very softly, and with a degree of persuasion in her voice.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, Turner, we will not press you too hard. I cannot
forget that you were my brother’s favorite and oldest servant,
and now his agent—that he trusted you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“He did indeed,” cried the old man, casting a glance full of
affection at me.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am sure you would do nothing that could cast reproach
on him,” continued the lady, placing a strong emphasis on the
pronoun.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Not for the universe,” ejaculated Turner.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yet, while you live thus—while there is a doubt left regarding
this child, cannot you see that even my noble brother may
be condemned as—as sanctioning—you understand—this species
of immorality—on his estates?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But how am I to prevent this?” exclaimed Turner, after a
moment of perplexed thought, during which he gazed on Lady
Catherine, as if searching for some meaning in her words which
they did not wholly convey.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Let me tell you—for I have been thinking on this subject a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>good deal—she is a fine-spirited girl that, a little wild and gipsyish;
but many of our guests were struck with her.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No wonder!” exclaimed Turner, with his face all in a glow.
“Who could help it?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“So they inquired a good deal about her, and when it came
out that she lived here under your protection, of course, it led
to questions and old things—nonsensical gossip about by-gone
times that quite made me nervous—you understand, good Turner.
So I told them what I am sure is the truth even yet—that
the Spanish woman here is her mother, that she is your
own child—that you are married.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Turner shook his head.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then it will be so,” persisted the lady, “or as I said before,
both woman and child must leave the estate.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You cannot be in earnest!” said Turner.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Does it seem like earnest when you find me here at this hour
of the morning?” replied the lady.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But it was Lord Clare’s desire—his command—that I hold
authority in this house until his return,” persisted Turner.</p>

<p class='c014'>“He mentions nothing of this in his letters to us. Besides,
you cannot mean to say that he has made such provisions for
these females.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, Zana was not here at the time; but I know, I am
sure”——</p>

<p class='c014'>“Be sure of nothing!” exclaimed Lady Catherine, with more
energy than she had yet exhibited—“be sure of nothing, if you
love your master, but that you can <em>serve</em> him best by silencing
this subject of public gossip at once. Marry the woman with
whom you have been so long domesticated!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“<em>Marry!</em>” exclaimed Turner, with a terrible twist of the
face, as if the word had not really come home to his heart till
then, “marry at this time of life, and a Spanish woman.
Wouldn’t it do as well, my lady, if they set me in the pillory
for an hour or so!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It might not do so well for the girl, perhaps,” was the stern
reply.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>“For her sake I would do anything!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is a great pity to keep the poor thing caged up here:
and what is to become of her in the end? As your daughter
she can come up to the house and see something of society.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What, a servant, madam?” cried Turner, reddening fiercely.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Nothing of the kind; you are no common man, Turner;
and certainly that child, with her wild, arch, nay, haughty
style, might pass anywhere. She shall come to the Hurst and
obtain some accomplishments. I should fancy her greatly
about the house. She might pick up a little education from
my son’s tutor, who will be down in a week or two, and become
quite an ornament to the establishment.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“She would be an ornament to any place,” said Turner,
proudly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes,” replied the lady, smiling upon me, “any man might
be proud of her for a daughter. I dare say we shall be excellent
friends soon—meantime think of what I have said. This
is a charming place, it would be a pity for the child to leave it.
To-morrow let me have your answer.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She moved proudly away, holding up her dress, and winding
carefully through the flower-beds, as if her errand had been the
commonest thing in the world.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXXIII.<br> <span class='large'>TURNER’S STRUGGLE AGAINST MARRIAGE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>I could not realize the importance of Lady Catherine’s visit
all at once. It had been carried on so quietly, so like the ordinary
common-place of her patrician life, that its meaning seemed
lost in sound. I could even amuse myself with the excitement
of poor Turner, who, folding his arms behind him, went furiously
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>pacing up and down the garden, treading everything down in
his path, and wading knee deep through the tall autumn blossoms,
jerking his feet among them now and then, as if it were
a relief to destroy anything that came in his way.</p>

<p class='c014'>I had never seen the old man in this mood before, and almost
thought him mad, for he muttered to himself, and seemed quite
unconscious that I was a witness to the scene.</p>

<p class='c014'>At last he came by the window with a long pendant of honeysuckle
trailing from his boot.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mr. Turner,” I said, laughing softly as he came up.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, you can be amused—easily amused—children always
are!” he exclaimed savagely. “Now can you see what mischief
that ride has done? Sit and laugh, truly—but what am
I to do?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Lady Catherine says you must get married,” I answered,
mischievously, for rage, instead of appalling, was invariably sure
to amuse me.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Married!” almost shrieked the old man, “and so you have
brought me to <em>that</em>, you—you!”</p>

<p class='c014'>The contortions of his face were too droll. I could not keep
from laughing again.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Zana,” said the old man, and tears absolutely stood in his
eyes, “I was good to you—I loved you—what right had you to
bring this misfortune on me? I knew that evil would come of
it when I found Jupiter’s stall empty; but marriage, oh, I did
not dream of that calamity.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And is marriage always a calamity?” I inquired, sobered by
his evident feeling.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes!”</p>

<p class='c014'>He hissed forth the monosyllable as if it had been a drop of
poison that burned his tongue.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And you dislike it very much?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Dislike it!”</p>

<p class='c014'>There is no describing the bitterness that he crowded into
these two words.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then do not—for my sake do not be married. Why
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>should you? I’m sure it will do me no good. I don’t care in
the least for it!”</p>

<p class='c014'>His sharp eyes brightened for an instant, and he looked at
me eagerly, like a convict on whom sudden hopes of escape
had dawned.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then you wouldn’t much mind leaving this place, Zana?”
he said.</p>

<p class='c014'>My heart sunk, but I strove to answer cheerfully.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, no, I—I don’t think it would seem so hard after a
little!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And Jupiter, and Cora?”</p>

<p class='c014'>I burst into tears.</p>

<p class='c014'>“There now, that is it—I’m answered—I was sure it would
break her little heart,” cried the old man, desperately—“I’ll do
it. I’ll bind myself, hand and foot—I’ll make an eternal old
fool of myself. I’ll—I’ll. It’s no use struggling, I’m sold, lost—tied
up—married!”</p>

<p class='c014'>He uttered the last word ferociously, casting it down as if it
had been a rock.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Not for me, Turner—not for me,” I said, losing all sense of
the ludicrous in his genuine repugnance to the measure Lady
Catherine had proposed. “I do not understand this—what on
earth is the reason they cannot let us live in peace?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Because you must be cutting loose from my authority—cantering
about like a little Nimrod in long skirts—fighting
hounds—getting acquainted with young men whom you ought
to hate—to hate, I say Miss Zana! Because you are a little
fool, and I am an old one. Because, because—but it’s no use
talking.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I began to see my disobedience in its true light. Certainly
it was impossible to comprehend why it had led to the necessity
which my old benefactor so much deplored, but I felt to the
bottom of my heart that this evil, whatever it was, had been
brought on by myself.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mr. Turner,” I said, “if I stay in-doors a month, nay, a
whole year, will it do any good?”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>“No—not the least!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What can I do? Indeed, indeed, Turner, I am very
sorry,” I persisted; “but let us go away; it will be far better
to leave Cora and Jupiter, the house and everything.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Why did I lose my voice so suddenly? Why did the
thought that George Irving was at Greenhurst depress my
heart and speech? I felt myself growing pale, and looking
despairingly around the lovely garden, for the first time realizing
how dear every flower had become.</p>

<p class='c014'>Turner looked at me wistfully, and at length went away. I
saw him an hour after wandering to and fro in the wilderness.
I did not leave the window, though breakfast had been long
waiting. The whole conversation had bewildered me. Why
should Turner dread this marriage so much—was it not right?
It seemed to me a very easy thing when so much depended on
it. I had never thought seriously of marriage in my whole life,
and its very mysteriousness made me look upon Turner as the
victim of some hidden evil. I was resolved that he should not
be sacrificed. What was my bonne, friends, Jupiter, to the
comfort of an old friend like him?</p>

<p class='c014'>I went forth into the wilderness, and found him sitting at the
root of a huge chestnut, with his clasped hands drooping idly
down between his knees, and gazing steadfastly on the earth.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Zana,” he said, reaching forth his hand, “sit down here,
and tell me all about it. What have I been saying? Have
I been very cross, darling?”</p>

<p class='c014'>His kindness went to my heart. I sat down upon a curved
root of the tree, and leaned softly against him.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, a little cross, but not half so much as I deserved,” I
said, meekly. “But tell me now, Mr. Turner, what is this
marriage, what is there so dreadful about it?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Nothing, child—nothing,” he answered, with forced cheerfulness.
“I dare say it is very pleasant—very pleasant indeed
to some people. I know of persons who are very fond of weddings,
quite charmed with them; but for my part a funeral
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>seems more the thing—there is some certainty about that. It
settles a man, leaves him alone, provides for him.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I never saw a wedding,” said I, thoughtfully, “and but
one funeral. That was very sad, Mr. Turner; if a wedding is
like that, don’t be married—it is dreadful! Are weddings like
that funeral ever?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I have seen weddings a great deal more solemn,” he
answered, still gazing on the ground. “One that seemed but
the mockery of a funeral, and ended in one!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What one was that?” I questioned, while a cold chill crept
mysteriously through my veins.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It was Lord Clare’s wedding that I was thinking of,” he
answered, looking up, “and that happened three days before I
found you on his door-step.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I looked fearfully around. It seemed as if a funeral train
were creeping through the woods—the ghost of some procession
that lived in my memory, yet would not give itself
forth.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And do they wish your wedding to be like that?” I whispered,
creeping close to him.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Like that!” said Turner, lifting up his eyes, “God forbid!
Mine, if it must be, is but the expiation of that!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And would Lord Clare desire it?—would he insist like
Lady Catherine?” I questioned. “Would he turn me out of
doors unless you married Maria, do you think?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“He turn you out of doors—he, child? I only wish we had
some way of reaching him!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Where is he now?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“In Africa, the last we heard, searching for what he will
never find.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And what is that, Mr. Turner?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Peace, child, peace—a thing that he will never know again
on this side the grave!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Is he a bad man then?” I persisted, strangely enthralled
by the subject.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>“Millions of worse men will live and revel after he has pined
himself into the grave.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Let us leave this place and seek for him,” I said, filled with
a sympathy so deep that my very heart trembled. “If he is
unhappy, you and I may do him some good.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, child, if you could but remember. If I had but some
little proof,” he answered, gazing at me impressively.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Proof of what, Turner?—what can you wish to prove?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“That in which nothing but God can help me!” was the
desponding reply.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It seemed to me,” said I, pressing each hand upon my
temples, for they were hot with unavailing thought—“it
seemed to me as if the thing that you wish to know was beating
in my brain all the time. Something there is, blank and
dark in my memory—how shall I bring it forth that you may
read it?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Wait God’s own time, my child,” answered the old man,
gently taking the hands from my temples, “sooner or later
that which we wish to learn will be made clear. Come now,
let us go home!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But they will not let us stay there, and I am ready to go,”
I remonstrated.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, they will let us stay now,” he answered, with a grim
smile.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Because I shall marry the <em>Spanish woman</em> to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c014'>There was a lingering bitterness in the emphasis placed on
the words Spanish woman, that lengthened the phrase for a
moment. It was the last I ever witnessed. Turner did not
sacrifice himself by halves.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Zana,” said the noble old man, as we moved slowly toward
the house, “you must not tell Maria of Lady Catherine’s visit,
or of—of my shameful passion after it. Women have strange
ideas about love, and so on, and she might take it into her
head to ask awkward questions if she knew all. Do you understand?”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>Yes, I understood perfectly. He was anxious to save the
poor Spanish woman from a knowledge of his repugnance to
the marriage. I promised the secrecy that he desired.</p>

<p class='c014'>We entered the breakfast-room together. Maria had been
waiting for us more than an hour, but she ran cheerfully for
the coffee urn and muffins without a word of comment.</p>

<p class='c014'>I saw Turner look at her with some appearance of interest
once or twice during the meal. The queer old philosopher
was evidently reconciling himself to the fate that an hour ago
had half driven him mad. Maria certainly looked younger
and more interesting than usual that morning. Unlike the
Spanish women in general, she wore her years becomingly,
the moist climate of England, and the quiet of her life conspiring
to keep from her the haggard look of old age
that marks even mid-life in her native land. The picturesque
costume which she had never been induced to change, was also
peculiarly becoming; the dark blue skirt and bodice of black
cloth; the long braids of her hair, slightly tinged with snow,
but gay with knots of scarlet ribbon; the healthy stoutness
of her person united in rendering my faithful bonne anything
but a repulsive person. I began to have less compassion for
Turner, and with the mobility of youth amused myself with
fancying Maria’s astonishment when she should learn what the
fates had in store for her.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXXIV.<br> <span class='large'>THE RELUCTANT PROPOSAL.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“Zana, child, will you see to the chrysanthemums that were
trailing across the walk this morning?—they will be trodden
down.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>I looked in Turner’s face as he said this, and felt a mischievous
smile quivering on my lips. The dear old fellow grew red
as a winter apple, then a grave, reproving look followed, and I
was glad to escape into the garden.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was very wrong, I admit, but a curiosity to see how Turner
would make love overpowered all sense of honor. I confess
to lingering in sight of the windows, cautiously keeping myself
out of view all the time. Turner and Maria still kept their
seats by the breakfast-table. His face was toward me, but I
could discern that one elbow was pressed on the table, and he
sat sideways, looking hard at the opposite wall while speaking.
But Maria was in full view, and a very picturesque portrait she
made framed in by the open window. I watched her face as it
changed from perplexity to wonder, from wonder to a strange
sort of bashful pleasure. Her cheeks grew red; her great, black,
Spanish eyes lighted up like those of a deer; yet she seemed
ashamed of the feelings speaking there, as if they were unbecoming
to her years.</p>

<p class='c014'>All at once she arose, and, coming round the table, leaned
against the window-frame. This movement brought me within
hearing, but I could not escape without being discovered; so
after taking one wrong step, I was forced into another still more
dishonorable. At first Maria spoke in her usual broken English,
which I cannot attempt to give, as its peculiarity lay rather
in the tone than the words.</p>

<p class='c014'>“This is very strange, Mr. Turner. Why do you speak of
this thing now after so many years? What has happened that
you talk to me of marriage? You say it is better for the child—better
for us all. But why?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I will make a good husband to you—at any rate do the
best I can!” pleaded poor Turner, sadly out of place in his
love-making.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Perhaps you have fallen in love with me all of a sudden,”
said my bonne, half bitterly, half in a questioning manner, as
if she faintly hoped he would assent to the idea.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I—what, I fall in love!” cried Turner, and his face writhed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>into a miserable smile; “it isn’t in me to make a fool of myself
at this age. I hope you have a better opinion of me than
that.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She answered rapidly, and partly in Spanish. There was a
good deal of womanly bitterness in her voice, but I could only
gather a few hasty ejaculations.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You joke, Mr. Turner—you mock—you have found a way
of amusing yourself with the lone stranger. I know that you
always hated us Spaniards, but you never mocked me in this
way till now.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“There it is again,” exclaimed the poor suitor. “I guessed
how it would all turn out; never did know how to manage one
of the sex—never shall! Look here, Maria, I’m in earnest—very
much in earnest; ask Lady Catherine—ask Zana if I’m
not determined on it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Turner gathered himself up, moved awkwardly enough toward
Maria, and taking her hand looked at it wistfully, as if
quite uncertain what to do next.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I never kissed a woman’s hand in my life,” he said, desperately,
“but I’ll kiss yours, on my soul I will, if you’ll just
marry me without more ado.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She leaned heavily against the window, and said more temperately,</p>

<p class='c014'>“Say, why have you asked this of me?”</p>

<p class='c014'>I do not know what Turner would have replied, for, obeying
the impulse of the moment, I came forward, and before either
of them were aware of my approach, stood in the room.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Tell her the whole, dear Mr. Turner,” I said, going up to
Maria with a degree of reverence I had never felt for her before.
“She ought to know it—she must know that you are asking
her to marry you that Lady Catherine may not turn us all
adrift on the world; that the people may stop pointing at me
because I have no father.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Maria flung her arms around me.</p>

<p class='c014'>“There—there!” exclaimed Turner, moving toward the door,
“you see I’ve done my best, Zana, and have got everybody
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>crying. Tell her yourself, child; just arrange it between you;
call for me when all’s ready; what I say I stand to.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The old man writhed himself out of the room, leaving Maria
and I together.</p>

<p class='c014'>My good, bonne was greatly agitated, and besought me to
explain the scene I had interrupted, but I could not well understand
it myself. All I knew was, that this marriage had been
demanded by Lady Catherine as a condition of our remaining
in the house. I repeated, word for word, what I had gathered
of the conversation between her and Turner, omitting only
those expressions of reluctance that had escaped my benefactor.
She listened attentively, but being almost a child, like
myself, in English custom, could not comprehend why this
necessity had arisen for any change in our condition.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And do you hate Mr. Turner so much?” I said, breaking
a fit of thoughtfulness into which she had fallen. “I thought
you liked each other till now; don’t, oh, my bonne, don’t marry
him if it troubles you so! You and I can get a living somehow
without taking him from his place.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes—two children—why, Zana, you know more of the
world than I do. Where could we go?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I don’t know, without Mr. Turner, what we should do,” I
answered, sadly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Without him, why, Zana—without him we should both
die!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, Maria, my bonne, if you could but like Mr. Turner,
only a little, just enough to marry him, you know!” I exclaimed,
amid my tears.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Like him, Zana? I have had nothing but him and you in
the world for years,” she said, weeping.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then you do like him—you will marry him!” I exclaimed,
full of joy.</p>

<p class='c014'>She strained me to her bosom and kissed me in her old passionate
way. I sprang from her arms the moment they were
loosened, and ran off in search of Mr. Turner.</p>

<p class='c014'>He was working in the garden, stamping the earth around a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>young laburnum tree, which he had just planted, with a sort of
ferocious vehemence, as if striving to work away some lingering
irritation.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Go in and speak with her now,” I said, pulling his arm.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, I’ve made a fool of myself once, and that is enough!”
he answered, shaking me off. “I didn’t think any woman living
could have driven me to it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Still he moved toward the house.</p>

<p class='c014'>That evening Mr. Turner was absent both from our cottage
and the Hurst. He came back the next day with a portentous-looking
paper, which he and Maria scanned over with great
interest. When I asked regarding it, they told me, with a
good deal of awkwardness, that it was a marriage license.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXXV.<br> <span class='large'>THE JOVIAL WEDDING AND RANDOM SHOT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Two or three mornings after this, I was sent over to the parsonage
to spend the day with Cora. Maria took more than
usual care in dressing me. I went forth in a white muslin
dress, fluttering with rose-colored ribbons, quite too fairy-like
for my usual morning visits to this my second home. But
Cora was also floating about in clouds of white muslin, with
glimpses of azure here and there about her arms and bosom,
as if arrayed for some festival. How flowerlike was the style
of her loveliness! Those ringlets of glossy gold; the violet
eyes full of softness, downcast, and yet so brilliant when she
smiled; the rounded arms, the neck and shoulders, white and
satiny as when I first saw them by the spring; the little foot
and hand, slender and rosy: all these points of beauty are before
me this instant, vividly as if painted on canvas. There is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>a reason why they should have sunk deep into my heart—a
cruel reason which the hereafter will disclose.</p>

<p class='c014'>Her father was in his clerical robes, walking up and down
the little parlor gently, as he always moved, and with a soft
smile on his lips, as if amusing himself with some odd fancy.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Come in, my child,” he said, with a change of expression,
brought on, I felt, by a more serious current of thought which
my appearance suggested. “Come in—you will find Cora in
her room.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I paused, as was my habit, to kiss his hand in passing, but
he detained me a moment, pressing his lips upon my forehead.</p>

<p class='c014'>“God bless you,” he said, “and make you worthy of all that
your friends are so willing to suffer in your behalf.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I went away to Cora’s room. I have told you how very lovely
she appeared in her pretty dress, but it is impossible to describe
the graceful undulations of each movement, the bewitching softness
of her smile! My own olive complexion and deep bloom
seemed coarse and rude beside her.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And so you have come to the wedding,” she said, wreathing
her arm around my waist, and drawing me before the little
mirror at which she had been dressing. “Isn’t it a droll affair
altogether?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“They are very kind, very good to me,” I replied, a little
hurt by her air of ridicule.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And to me!” was her laughing reply; “this is the very
first wedding I shall have seen. Isn’t it charming. The people
will be here from Greenhurst; the young heir, perhaps.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Why did that spasm shoot through my heart so suddenly?
I was looking upon the reflection of Cora’s beauty. It was a
lovely vision, but the color went from my own cheek as I gazed
on hers, and that made the contrast between us strange and
darker. I remembered that George Irving would look on that
lovely vision also; and the first sharp pang of jealousy known
to my life tore its way through my bosom. I did not know
what it was, but sickened under it as the grass withers beneath
an Upas tree.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>I struggled against myself, conscious that the feeling was
wrong, though ignorant of its nature, but other thoughts
mingled with these selfish ones. I was astonished and hurt
that strangers should force themselves upon a ceremony which
the parties desired to be private. It seemed rude and cruel to
the last degree.</p>

<p class='c014'>But I was called into the parlor. Turner and Maria were in
sight quietly crossing the fields together without the least pretention.
Maria looked nice and matronly in her dress of soft
grey silk and cap of snowy lace; Turner wore his ordinary suit
of black, for he had long since flung off livery, and bore his
usual business-like appearance. It was impossible to find anything
to condemn in persons so free from affectation of any
kind. For my part I was proud of my benefactors; there
was a respectability about them that no ridicule could reach.</p>

<p class='c014'>We entered a little church, and found it already occupied by
a large party of strangers, guests from Greenhurst. I saw
Turner start and change color as he went in, but pressing his
thin lips together till they were almost lost among his wrinkles,
he walked firmly on, holding Maria by the hand.</p>

<p class='c014'>I saw it all, I knew that he was suffering tortures from those
impertinent people, and all for my sake. It seemed as if my
presence would be some support to them; and when Cora
would have turned into a pew close to that occupied by Lady
Catherine, I resisted and led her up to the altar.</p>

<p class='c014'>There, on the very spot where Cora’s mother had rested in
her death sleep, Turner and Maria were married. I thought
of all this, and it made my heart swell with unshed tears; but
Cora seemed to have forgotten it entirely. Her downcast eyes
wandered sideways toward the intruders all the time. The
two great mysteries of life, death and marriage, which we had
witnessed, and were witnessing together by that altar stone,
were driven from her mind.</p>

<p class='c014'>The ceremony was over. Turner and his wife moved away,
passing through the crowd with a serious dignity that would
make itself respected. I would have followed close, but Cora
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>held back, keeping on a range with the intruders. Lady
Catherine was directly before us, leaning upon the arm of an
old gentleman I had seen in the hunt.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Ah, Lady Catherine, your benign goodness is felt everywhere,”
he was saying. “It must have had an angel’s power
in reforming this old stoic!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Hush,” said the lady, touching his arm with her gloved
finger, “his daughter is just behind us!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What, the little Diana!” exclaimed the gentleman, looking
over his shoulder. “I would give fifty pounds to see her
again.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“She will hear you!” whispered the lady, impatiently.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And who is the other little elf?” cried the old squire,
whose admiration was not to be subdued. “Why, dear lady,
you have a new race of fairies and goddesses springing up about
Greenhurst. Take heed that my friend George is not made
captive.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I followed the old squire’s look, and saw George Irving,
with another young man, fairer and taller than himself, with
their eyes riveted on Cora.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I remained with Cora all night. She was full of gleeful
gossip about the wedding, and more than once spoke of the young
gentleman who had looked at her so often. She did not say so
admiringly, but I knew well the glow of vanity that led her
thoughts that way, and the subject caused me unaccountable
pain. I listened to her, therefore, with impatience, and while
her beauty seemed more fascinating than ever, its brilliancy
wounded me. It was a precocious and wrong feeling, I confess,
but there were many passionate sensations in my heart even
then, which some women live from youth to age and never
know.</p>

<p class='c014'>I was reluctant to go home—to meet Turner and Maria after
the sacrifice and insult of the previous day. It seemed as if
they must hate me for being the cause of it all. But deep in
the morning, I put on my bonnet and prepared to return home.
Cora proposed to go part way with me, and though I preferred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>to be alone, she persisted with laughing obstinacy, and flinging
a scarf over her head, ran after me down the garden.</p>

<p class='c014'>I was very willing to loiter on the way, and we turned into
the fields enjoying the soft autumn air, and searching for hazelnuts
along the stone fences.</p>

<p class='c014'>We came to a thicket where the fruit was abundant, and so
ripe that we had but to shake the golden husks, and the nuts
came rattling in showers around us. I clambered up the wall,
and seizing a heavy branch from the thicket, showered the nuts
into the pretty silk apron which Cora held up with both white
hands.</p>

<p class='c014'>I think in my whole life I never saw anything so lovely as
she was at that moment. The blue scarf floated back upon the
wind, circling her head as you see the drapery around one of
Guido’s angels; her eyes sparkled with merriment: and she
shook back the curls from her face with a laugh, gleeful and
mellow, as if she had fed on ripe peaches all her days.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Stop, stop, you will smother me!” she shouted, gathering
the apron in a heap, and holding up both hands to protect her
curls from the shower of nuts that I was impetuously beating
over her.</p>

<p class='c014'>I paused, instantly, ashamed of the action, which had been
unconscious as it was violent.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Did the nuts hurt you?” I said, bending forward to address
her.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, no; just a little when they struck my forehead: nothing
more!” she said, still laughing, but with the rosy palm of her
hand pressed to one temple that was slightly flushed.</p>

<p class='c014'>That instant I heard the report of a fowling-piece close by,
and a thrush fell, with a death shriek, down to the hazel
thicket. It beat its wings about among the green leaves an
instant, then fell heavily through, lodging at Cora’s feet. Her
laugh died away in a sob; the poor thing grew pale as death,
and I saw with a shudder that two great drops of blood had
fallen upon her neck.</p>

<p class='c014'>She dropped the nuts from her apron, and sank down to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>earth. I sprang upright on the wall and looked around,
excited and angry, for the shot had rattled against the very
stones upon which I was seated.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Great heavens! what is this? Are you hurt?” cried a
voice, and I saw George Irving, with his young companion of
the previous day, running toward us; while a fine pointer cleared
the wall in search of the dead bird.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I do not know; there is blood on Cora’s neck, it may be
only from the bird,” I answered, leaping to the ground. “Cora,
Cora, look up—are you hurt?”</p>

<p class='c014'>I trembled from head to foot, and strove to lift her from the
ground, for she made no answer. Some one cleared the wall
with the leap of a deer and pushed me aside. I saw Cora lifted
in the arms of a young man, and heard her begin to sob with
hysterical violence.</p>

<p class='c014'>“She is not hurt; it is not her blood!” he said, in a voice so
calm, that though full of music, it grated on my ear, and with
his cambric handkerchief he wiped the blood spots from her neck.
“She is frightened a little, nothing more.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Nothing more!” exclaimed Irving, passionately, “why, is
not that enough, brigands that we are, to terrify the sweet
child into this state!”</p>

<p class='c014'>I felt myself growing cold from head to foot, for Irving had
taken the weeping girl from her supporter, and held her gently
in his own arms. She opened her eyes—those beautiful violet
eyes—and a smile broke through the tears that filled them.</p>

<p class='c014'>I grew faint, a mist crept around me, and I leaned against the
wall for support. No one seemed to observe it, for I made no
noise, and they were busy with her.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am glad, that it is no worse; the leaves were so thick, and
I looked only at the bird: Can you stand now? The blood is
all away, nothing but a rosy glow on your neck is left to reproach
us.”</p>

<p class='c014'>It was Irving’s voice, and I could see dimly as through a
mist that Cora still clung to him, and that he was looking into
her eyes. Then I heard another voice, calm and caustic as if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>feelings like my own lay at the bottom, suppressed but observant.</p>

<p class='c014'>“In all this you overlook the real evil,” it said, “don’t you
see, Irving, that while this child does not require so much care,
the other is really suffering—nay, wounded?”</p>

<p class='c014'>I felt a sharp pain in my arm, just above the elbow, as he
spoke, forgotten till then in the more bitter pang at my heart;
and through the mistiness that still crept over my eyes, I saw
a slender stream of crimson trickling down and dropping from
my fingers.</p>

<p class='c014'>“She is hurt indeed—a shot has gone through her arm,”
exclaimed Irving, and I felt through every nerve that he had
put Cora away from his support almost forcibly, and was close
by me. Young as I was, the master feeling of my nature awoke
then, and I started from the wall, dizzy and confused, but determined
that he should not touch me.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is nothing,” I said, winding my handkerchief around the
arm, and turning haughtily away. “Come, Cora, shall we go?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Let me rest, Zana, I am so tired and frightened!” she
said, and her beautiful eyes filled again.</p>

<p class='c014'>Irving’s face flushed crimson as I repulsed his offered support,
and though the look with which he regarded me was regretful,
it was proud too. When Cora spoke in her sweet pleading
way, he bent his eyes upon her with an expression of relief, but
turned to me again.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is an accident; you cannot suppose I wounded you on
purpose,” he said, pleadingly. “Why are you so unforgiving?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“There is nothing to forgive,” was my cold answer.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You are wounded! Is that nothing?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is nothing; and if it were, the wound was not intended
for me.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He looked at me earnestly, as if pained and embarrassed by
the manner with which I received his apologies; then he turned
toward Cora.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I hope my friend is not mistaken—that I have not injured
you also.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>“No,” replied Cora, casting her eyes to the ground and
blushing. “I was terrified; the feeling of blood: fear for Zana
made me tremble, but I am not hurt.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Thank heaven!” exclaimed young Irving, and gathering
up her azure scarf, he dropped it lightly over the shining gold
of her hair. I watched him with burning indignation. His
gentle interest in Cora, who was all unharmed, seemed a mockery
to the stinging pain of my arm. I forgot how coldly I had
received his sympathy, and like all impulsive but proud natures,
fancied that he must read my feelings, not my actions, and
judged him by the fancy.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I must go home now, the morning is almost gone!” I said
to Cora. “Are you well enough to move on?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, I tremble yet,” she said sweetly; “your wound pains
me more than it does yourself, Zana, it has taken away all my
strength.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then I will go alone,” was my curt rejoinder. “My arm
bleeds.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I started suddenly, and almost ran toward home.</p>

<p class='c014'>Directly I heard a light step following me.</p>

<p class='c014'>“This is unkind, cruel!” said Irving, pleading; “let me help
you?”</p>

<p class='c014'>The pride of my heart was subdued; I relaxed the speed
with which I had moved, and listened with a thrill of grateful
pleasure.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You smile—your color comes back, thanks!” he said,
gaily.</p>

<p class='c014'>I could not answer. The sweet sensations that overwhelmed
me were too exquisite for words.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You will not speak to me,” said Irving, stooping forward
to look in my face.</p>

<p class='c014'>My eyes met his, I felt the lids drooping over them, and,
spite of myself, began to tremble with delicious joy. Like a
cup full of honey, my heart overflowed with sighs, but I could
neither speak nor look him in the face. Did he understand it
all? Did he read in my face all that was making a heaven in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>my heart? All I know is, that he grew silent like myself, and
we moved on together through the soft atmosphere like two
young creatures in a dream. At length some obstacle arose in
our path. I know not how it was, but we paused and looked
at each other. My eyes did not droop then, but were fascinated
by the deep, earnest tenderness that filled his. I met
that gaze, and kept it forever in my soul, the most solemn and
beautiful memory ever known to it.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Zana, do you love me?”</p>

<p class='c014'>The question fell upon my ear like a whisper of expected
music. I had listened for it with hushed breath, for with the
soft atmosphere of love all around me, it came naturally as
lightning in a summer cloud. I think he repeated the question
twice before the joy at my heart sprang with a deep, delicious
breath to my lips.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Zana, do you love me?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Do I love you? Yes, oh, yes!”</p>

<p class='c014'>As the words left my soul, a calm, solemn contentment
brooded down like a dove upon it. The feeling was too holy
and sweet for blushes. It seemed to me as if I had partaken
of an angel’s nature while uttering it. Up to that
moment I had never dwelt upon the thought of love, save as a
pleasant household feeling. The passion of love I did not even
then comprehend, notwithstanding it beat in every pulse of my
warm southern blood.</p>

<p class='c014'>He took my hand, holding it with a firm, gentle pressure, and
thus we walked on softly and still as the summer air moves
among the daisies. I can imagine Adam and Eve walking thus
in Paradise, when the temptation first crept across their path.
I can imagine them starting at the evil thing, as we did when
Irving’s tutor came suddenly upon us. He was a sweet-voiced,
quiet man some ten years older than Irving, and a great favorite
with Lady Catherine. I did not like his manners, they were
fawning and yet cold—his very humility was oppressive.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You walk slowly,” he said, in his calm, silky way; “no
wonder, it is a delightful morning.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>Irving tightened his grasp on my hand.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You can find the way home now,” he said, dropping it and
turning away with his tutor.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Nay, this is ungallant, Irving,” said that person, moving
toward me; “you forget her arm seems hurt.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, I had forgotten it,” was the reply, and he came back.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Can you forgive me!”</p>

<p class='c014'>I, too, had forgotten it.</p>

<p class='c014'>“There is no pain left,” was my answer. “Go away with
him, he troubles me.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And me!” was the murmured reply.</p>

<p class='c014'>They went away together, leaving me alone with my great
happiness.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is said that love gives beauty to all material things. It
may be so with others, but to me nature looked faded and
insignificant that day. I longed for a rainbow in the skies;
for a carpet of blossoms under my feet; for the breath of roses
in every gush of air. Nothing but heaven could have matched
the beautiful joy of my soul.</p>

<p class='c014'>For three days my rich contentment lasted. During that
time I scarcely seemed to have a mortal feeling. When fancy
could sustain itself no longer, came the material want of his
presence. My heart had fed upon its one memory over and
over again. Now it grew hungry for fresh certainties. I
began to think of the future, to speculate and doubt. Why
had he kept away? Where was he now? Had I been dreaming—only
dreaming?</p>

<p class='c014'>I did not observe Turner and Maria in their new relations.
At another time their awkward tenderness and shy love-making
would have amused me, but now I scarcely remarked it, and in
their embarrassment they forgot to notice me.</p>

<p class='c014'>Perhaps they would have detected nothing remarkable had
they been ever so vigilant, for I was self-centred in my own
happiness, and joy like mine was too deep and dreamy for easy
detection.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>On the third day, Lady Catherine sent for me to come up to
the Hurst. It seems she was resolved to carry out her plan of
giving me such accomplishments as I could pick up, without
expense, from her son’s tutor, and her own waiting-maid.</p>

<p class='c014'>I went, not without a pang of wounded pride, but too happy
in the hope of seeing him again, for thought of much else.
Lady Catherine was in her dressing-room, and several ladies,
whom I afterward learned were guests from London, had joined
her, it seems, curious to see the wild wood-nymph who had
made a sensation at the hunt.</p>

<p class='c014'>Lady Catherine half rose from her silken lounge as I entered,
and motioned me to sit down on an embroidered ottoman, first
lifting from it a little tan-colored spaniel, which she settled
beside her on the couch. I sat down, with a burning forehead,
for it was easy to see that she placed me and the dog on an
equal level, if indeed the animal did not meet with higher estimation
than the human pet.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Isn’t she a spirited, wild little beauty?” she said, addressing
a young girl some two years older than myself, perhaps, who
was busy working seed-pearls into a bit of embroidery.</p>

<p class='c014'>The young lady looked coldly up, and, after scanning me
from head to foot, dropped her eyes again, murmuring something
about my being older than she had supposed. Lady
Catherine drew her hand down the folds of my hair, exclaiming
at its thickness and lustre, just as she had handled the silky
ears of her King Charles a moment before.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Did you ever see anything so long and so raven black,” she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>said, uncoiling a heavy braid from around my head, and holding
it up at full length.</p>

<p class='c014'>“That sort of hair is often seen in persons of mixed blood,”
answered the young lady, without lifting her eyes, “long, but of
a coarser texture. I must confess black is not my favorite
color.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You must take an interest in this poor child—indeed you
must, Estelle; I have quite depended on it—she will be quick
to learn: won’t you, child? Let her look over some of your
drawings, Estelle. I dare say she never saw anything like them
in her life!”</p>

<p class='c014'>The young lady kept at her work, not seeming to relish the
idea of amusing a creature so disagreeable as she evidently
found me. Lady Catherine arose; she spoke to the young girl
in a subdued voice, but not a syllable escaped me.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Nay, love, you must. It will please George more than
anything; besides, I promised as much to her father in order
to induce him to abandon that horrid way of life. It is quite
a moral duty to civilize the child, now that the parents are
married; George looks upon it in this light, I assure you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I would do anything to please him, you know,” said the
girl, half sullenly, “but he never sees my efforts; never cares
for them.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Who should know, dearest, but the mother who is his confidant?”
was the caressing reply. “How can you doubt what
I tell you?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well,” replied the girl, rising, “let the child come to my
dressing-room!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, love,” interposed Lady Catherine; “bring them here—I
never weary of them myself.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The young lady withdrew, and returned with a richly embroidered
portfolio crowded full of drawings. She spread them
out upon a table, and haughtily motioned me to approach.</p>

<p class='c014'>The drawings were evidently copies highly finished, but variable
as if more than one pencil had performed its part there.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>My quick intuition told me this at a glance, and I looked into
the girl’s face with a feeling of scorn which doubtless spoke in
my features. She probably held me in so much contempt that
my look was unnoticed, for she continued to turn over the
drawings with haughty self-possession, as if quite careless of
any opinion I might form.</p>

<p class='c014'>At last we came to a head sketched with care, and evidently
an attempt at some likeness.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Do you know that?” said Estelle, “probably you have
never seen Mr. Irving.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I have seen Mr. Irving,” was my answer, “but this is not
in the least like him.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Perhaps you could draw a better one!” she said, casting
a sneering smile toward Lady Catherine, but with rising color,
as if she were a good deal vexed.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Perhaps,” I answered very quietly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Try,” said the haughty girl, taking a pencil and some
paper from a pocket of the portfolio.</p>

<p class='c014'>I took the pencil, dropped on one knee by the table, and,
excited by her sneers into an attempt that I should have held
almost sacrilegious at another time, transferred a shadow of the
image that filled my soul to the paper. I felt the look of
haughty astonishment with which the young patrician bent over
me as I worked out the quick inspiration.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What is she doing?” inquired Lady Catherine, gliding
toward the table. “Why, Estelle, you seem entranced.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Estelle drew proudly back, and pointed toward me with a
sneering lift of the upper lip, absolutely hateful.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You have found a prodigy here, madam, nothing less,” she
said; “what a memory the creature must have to draw like
that with only one sight of your son’s face!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Lady Catherine bent over me, and I felt that she breathed
unequally, like one conquering an unpleasant surprise.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What an impression that one interview must have made,”
persisted the young lady.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>“I have seen Mr. Irving more than once or twice,” I answered,
without pausing in the rapid touches of my pencil, though my
heart beat loud and fast as I spoke.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Indeed,” sneered the girl with a glance at Lady Catherine.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Indeed!” repeated that lady, with forced unconcern; “the
child wanders among the trees like a bird, Estelle, you have
no idea what a wild gipsy it is; we must civilize her between
us.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Is Mr. Irving to help? It looks like that,” answered
Estelle, spitefully.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Is there anything in which I can be of service?” said a
voice that made the heart leap in my bosom; but so perfect
was my self-control that I finished the shadow upon which I
was at work mechanically, as if every nerve in my system were
not thrilling like the strings of an instrument.</p>

<p class='c014'>“We were speaking about humanizing this strange child a
little,” said Lady Catherine; “she really has a good deal of
originality, as we were saying, and Estelle is quite charmed
with the idea of bringing it out.”</p>

<p class='c014'>My soul was full of scornful ridicule. I felt it breaking up
through my eyes, and curving my lip as I looked from Estelle
to George Irving. His own face caught the spirit, and he met
my glance with a bright smile of intelligence, that others read
as well as myself.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Did you ever try to teach music to a woodlark, dear mother?”
he said, stooping down to look at the head I had
sketched.</p>

<p class='c014'>My heart stood still, but I would not permit myself to blush;
on the contrary, there was a dry, cold feeling about my lips as
if the blood were leaving them; but my gaze was fascinated. I
could not turn it from his face, and when the warm crimson
rushed up over his brow and temples, as the likeness struck him,
my breath was absolutely stopped. I would have given the
universe for the power of obliterating my own work from the
paper and from his brain. There was anger, reproach, and a
dash of scorn in the glance which he turned from the likeness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>to my face. I trembled from head to foot. The lids drooped
like lead over the shame that burned in my eyes; a feeling that
he thought my act indelicate scorched me like a fire.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The likeness does not seem to please you, Mr. Irving,” said
Estelle, and her face brightened. “In my humility I had supposed
it better than my poor attempt.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, it was only a copy, then!” he cried, laughing, and the
cloud left his face; “this is your first lesson, and my poor features
the subject. You honor them too much; pray whose
selection was it?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I believe my sketch gave rise to the other,” answered
Estelle, casting down her fine eyes, and certainly mistaking the
feelings she had excited.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am glad of it,” answered Irving, and the glow of his
countenance bore proof of his sincerity.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Now,” said Lady Catherine, in her usual way, which with
all its softness had authority in it, “let us settle things for the
morning. We visit Marston Court; Estelle has never been
thoroughly over the house; of course you go, George.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He did not seem embarrassed, but thoughtful, and, after a
moment’s consideration, replied, “Yes, I will escort you on
horseback. Who are going?”</p>

<p class='c014'>The guests were enumerated. Most of the names I had
never heard before. My own was not in the list.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And Zana!” said Irving, with a slight rise of color when
his mother paused.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, Zana, she will find amusement for herself. She has
never seen the house yet—besides, as your tutor remains behind,
he can take the opportunity to give her a lesson or two.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Lady Catherine looked furtively at her son as she made the
proposition. His brow clouded, and his lips were set together
very resolutely; but his voice was low and respectful as he replied,</p>

<p class='c014'>“Not so, madam! Unless in your presence, that gentleman
is not a proper person to teach a girl like Zana!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Hear me, you are really making the thing a burden. How
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>can you expect all these formalities, George, in a case like this—and
me with nerves worn down to a thread?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I will teach her myself,” was the firm reply, though rays of
crimson shot across his forehead as he spoke.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You, George?—preposterous!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why preposterous, madam?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Your youth!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Is my tutor old?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Your position—your prospects!”</p>

<p class='c014'>He laughed in a gay, light fashion.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, should my Uncle Clare marry again, a thing not unlikely,
exercise of this kind will be a useful experience, for then
I shall have little but my brains to depend on.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But he will never marry!—who thinks it?” cried the
mother impatiently.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Men of a little more than forty do not often consider
themselves out of the matrimonial market, mother.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You talk wildly, George. Clare will never marry again—never,
never!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And if he does not, am I his next heir?—or my hopes
of advancement and fortune rest on you, lady mother?—you
who certainly will not own yourself too old for a second
marriage!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“This is nonsense, George!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, sober truth; my uncle—whom heaven preserve, for he
is a good man—could aid me nothing in his death. <em>You</em> would
inherit, not your son; the ladies of our line are a privileged
race.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But are you not my only son and heir?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“True again; and your favorite while I do not offend.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“That you will never do,” answered the mother, with a glow
of feeling in her voice.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I hope not, mother,” he said, lifting her hand to his lips
with an expression of earnest affection. “But do not talk to
me of expectations that may be dreams; and rank that may find
me, when it comes, a broken-hearted old man!”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>“This is strange talk, George, and in this presence. Estelle
will learn to look upon your prospects with distrust.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“She, with all my friends, will do well to think of me only
as I am, the dependent of a good uncle, certain of nothing but
a firm will, good health, and an honest purpose!” he answered,
glancing, not at the haughty patrician, but at me.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And that is enough for any man,” I exclaimed, filled with
enthusiasm by his proud frankness. “What inheritance does
he require but that honest, firm will, which cleaves its own
way in the world? Oh, how the soul must enjoy the blessings
which its own strength has had the power to win. If I were a
man, neither gold nor rank should detract from my native
strength. I would go into the world and wrestle my way
through, not for the wealth or the power that might come of it—but
for the strength it would give to my own nature—the
development—the refining process of exertion—the sense of
personal power. In that must lie all the true relish of greatness!”</p>

<p class='c014'>The guests had one by one glided from Lady Catherine’s
room before her son came in, and no one listened to our conversation
but her ladyship and the girl Estelle. When I
ceased speaking, Lady Catherine sunk among the cushions of
her couch, lifting the dog to her bosom as if she feared my rash
words would poison the creature; while her young friend stood
close by with both arms folded scornfully over her bosom, gazing
at me from her open eyes, as if there had been something
wicked in my expression. For myself, the moment my rash
enthusiasm gave way, all courage went with it; and before the
fire had left my eyes they were full of tears.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Is the creature mad, or a sibyl?” said Lady Catherine, in
a voice that went through and through me.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mother,” said her son, pale as death, but with a strange
glory of expression in his face—“need you ask again whose
blood spoke there?”</p>

<p class='c014'>He addressed her in a whisper, but she turned white, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>lifted her finger to check his further speech, glancing at
Estelle.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Strange language this for the daughter of a servant!”
exclaimed Estelle, her bosom heaving with scornful astonishment.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am not the daughter of a servant,” was the reply that
sprang to my lips; “the story is a falsehood. Turner is my
benefactor, my more than father: <em>not</em> my father; but if he were,
why should my words, if right, not spring from the lips of <em>his</em>
child? Are all gifts reserved for the patrician? Does not the
great oak and the valley lily spring from exactly the same soil?
Thank heaven there is no monopoly in thought!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“In heaven’s name, who taught you these things?” cried
Lady Catherine, aghast.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Who teaches the flowers to grow, and the fruit to ripen?”
I answered, almost weeping, for my words sprang from an
impulse, subtle and evanescent as the perfume of a flower;
and like all sensitive persons I shrunk from the remembrance of
my own mental impetuosity.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Really, your ladyship, you must excuse me, this is getting
tiresome,” said Estelle, sweeping from the room; “I fear with
all your goodness the child will prove a troublesome pet.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Lady Catherine sat among her cushions very white, and
with a glitter in her eyes that I had learned to shrink from.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Irving,” she said, speaking to him in a low but firm voice,
“plead with me no more—she must and shall leave the estate.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Madam, she is but a child!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“A mischievous one, full of peril to us all, and therefore, to
be disposed of at once. Out of my own income I will provide
for her wants, but away from this place—in another land, perhaps.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I felt myself growing pale, and saw that Irving was also
greatly agitated. He looked at me reproachfully, and muttered,
“imprudent—imprudent.” I went to a window, and leaning
against the frame, stood patiently, and still as marble, waiting
for my sentence. Again my rashness had perilled all that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>I loved; the thought froze me through and through; I hated myself.
Irving was talking to his mother; she had forgotten dignity,
her elegance, everything in her indignation against me. At
last I caught some of his words. They were deep and determined.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, mother, I will not consent. If our suspicions are true,
and I must confess every day confirms them in my estimation—the
course you propose would be impolitic as cruel. You cannot
keep her existence from Lord Clare; all that we guess he
will soon learn. He is just, noble—think if he would forgive
this persecution of—of an orphan—for she is that if nothing
more!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But am I to be annoyed—braved, talked down by a child,
and before my own guests?” said the mother. “Who knows
the mischief she has already done with Estelle?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mother, I beseech you, let that subject drop. It is a
dream.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“One of the best matches in England, my son; a golden
dream worth turning to reality.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, mother, in this I must be free.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Perhaps you are not free! That child!”</p>

<p class='c014'>They were looking in each other’s eyes, the mother and
son reading thoughts there that each would gladly have concealed
from the other. I came forward.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Madam, let me go home, I am not fit for this place. Let
me return, and I will trouble you no more.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I wish to heaven it were possible for you to keep this
promise, girl.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Let me go home; send for me no more; I will never willingly
cross your path again.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Nor his?” said the mother, fixing her cold eyes on my face,
and pointing to her son.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Madam, I beseech you, let me go.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But I have promised Turner to educate you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Lady, you cannot. Mr. Clarke has taken great care of me,
and in some shape I have educated myself.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>“You are a strange girl.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I feel strange here. May I go?”</p>

<p class='c014'>She fell into thought with her eyes on my face, as if it had
been a work of marble.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes,” she said, at length, “go, but I feel that we have not
done with each other. Now, George, equip at once; we have
kept our guests waiting!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, mother, I cannot go to Marston Court; make my
excuses!”</p>

<p class='c014'>He went out, leaving no time for a rejoinder; and Lady
Catherine followed. I was alone in the room.</p>

<p class='c014'>All at once a strange sensation came over me. I looked
around with a vague feeling of dread. Things that I had not
before noticed were strangely familiar. It seemed as if I were
in a dream, and without volition, and without object, I crossed
the room toward a small antique cabinet that stood in one
corner. The lids were deeply carved and set heavily with
jewels. It is a solemn truth, I was unconscious of the act, but
unclosing the cabinet reached forth my hand, and opened a
small, secret drawer that was locked with a curious spring.</p>

<p class='c014'>Among other trinkets, two lockets of gold lay within the
drawer; one shaped like a shell, and paved thickly with pearls;
the other plain, and without ornament of any kind. I took up
the shell, and it sprung open in my hand, revealing two faces
that seemed like something that had floated in my dreams years
ago. One was that of a man in the first proud bloom of youth,
with a brow full of lofty thought, but fair and of a delicate
whiteness that we seldom see beyond infancy. The lips and
the deep blue eyes seemed smiling upon me, and with a pang of
love, for it was half pain, I kissed it. The female face I <em>could
not look upon</em>. It seemed to me like the head of an evil spirit
that was to haunt my destiny, and yet it possessed a wonderful
fascination to me.</p>

<p class='c014'>I laid the shell down, and with a sort of mysterious awe
took up the other locket. It opened with difficulty, and when
I wrenched the spring apart, it seemed as if my very soul had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>received a strain. It was a miniature also. I looked upon it
and the claw of some fierce bird seemed clutched upon my
bosom and throat. It appeared to me as if I struggled minutes
and minutes in its gripe; then the pressure gave way, and
with a burst of tears I cried out, “the face!—the face!”</p>

<p class='c014'>A thin hand was thrust over my shoulder and snatched the
locket away. I turned and saw it in the grasp of Lady Catherine.
With a choking cry my hands were flung out, and I
leaped madly upward striving to snatch it.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Would you steal? Are you a thief?” she cried, grasping
the locket tight, and holding it on high. “Would you steal?
Are you a thief?”</p>

<p class='c014'>The words went hissing through my ear. A hot flush of
indignant shame clouded my sight, and I saw George Irving,
as it were, through waves of crimson gauze, looking sternly
upon me.</p>

<p class='c014'>Then all grew black and still as death.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXXVII.<br> <span class='large'>SORROWS, DOUBTS AND CONJECTURES.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The cold dash of water on my face aroused me, and I awoke
gasping for breath as if my very soul had felt the icy deluge.
Only one person remained in the room, and he was so white
that it seemed like waking among the dead. A heavy weight
still rested on my brain, and after a struggle or two I felt
myself sinking as one falls from some precipice in a dream. All
at once it appeared to me that I had been pulled back with violence.
My lips burned as if a handful of thorns had been
drawn across them, and again my heavy eyelids were lifted.
Lady Catherine had entered the room. It was the antipathy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>of our natures that dragged me violently back from unconsciousness.
Instantly the pang of remembrance returned, and
its agony gave me strength to hear but not to move.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Is she conscious yet?” said Lady Catherine, touching me
with the point of her satin slipper.</p>

<p class='c014'>“She has moved a little,” answered a voice, so deep and
sorrowful that my heart stood still to listen.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Let something be done; I am sick of her! Burn feathers,
bring aromatic vinegar—why, is no servant at hand?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You would not expose the poor child thus to our servants,
mother?” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The poor child, indeed! George, George, this is too much!
Yes, I would expose her to the lowest scullion about the place—poor
child! The thief!—the”——</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mother!”</p>

<p class='c014'>My heart leaped at the stern rebuke conveyed in this single
word. I broke through the leaden feeling that held me motionless
and rose to my feet, reeling and half blind, but stung into
life by the epithet that unwomanly lady had applied to me.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Madam,” I said, striving to sweep the mist from my eyes
with one hand—“madam, you are false, body and soul. You
know that I could not steal the picture of my own mother.
God gives to every child a mother. Who shall say that the
shadow of mine can belong to any one else; or, if it did, that I
might not look at it?”</p>

<p class='c014'>She interrupted me with a bitter laugh, in sickening contrast
with her usual hollow-hearted loftiness.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The picture of <em>your</em> mother, and in Lord Clare’s escritoir!”
she exclaimed; “upon my word, George, this impudence is
sublime.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It <em>was</em> my mother!” I answered firmly, but with a swelling
heart. “Mr. Irving, you believe me.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I reached forth my hand to the young man, and he took it—held
it—pressed his cold lips upon it, and thus proclaimed the
noble trust that was in him, while she looked on.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mother!” and the words burst like fire through his white
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>lips—“mother, I do believe the child innocent as God’s
angels!”</p>

<p class='c014'>These words bereft me of all strength. My limbs gave way
as if they had been moulded from snow. I fell at his feet, and
winding my arms about his knees, gave myself up to a passion
of tears.</p>

<p class='c014'>“George Irving, undo the coil of that serpent, spurn her
away, or henceforth you are no child of mine!” burst on my
ears.</p>

<p class='c014'>I saw that wicked glare of her eyes, the white rage that
shook her from head to foot. There was something horrid in
this fiendish rage in a mother, and addressed to her only child.
I took away my arms and arose.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Madam, calm yourself,” I said gently, for his faith had
filled my soul with solemn peace, “I shall touch him no more—see
him, probably, never again. You can separate us, but I
know that he believes me—it is enough!”</p>

<p class='c014'>I left the room without another word or look, and went
home.</p>

<p class='c014'>Two days after, Greenhurst was deserted. Lady Catherine
and her son, with some of their guests, had departed for the
Continent. He went without a word, but had I not given him
up proudly, there in the presence of his mother?</p>

<p class='c014'>Days, weeks, months rolled on, and after this terrible excitement
my outer life became a dead calm; my intellect, for once,
seemed to have lost its spring, and gave itself up to dreams.
For a long time my faith in Irving remained firm; and though
we never received a syllable from him, it seemed every day as
if I had obtained some confirmation of his love; and I solemnly
believe that no doubt would ever have arisen in my mind, but
that the poison was sown there by another.</p>

<p class='c014'>Those who know how sensibly a proud heart shrinks from the
idea that even a suspicion of crime can attach to it, will not
think it strange that I never mentioned the scene at Greenhurst
to Turner or Maria; nor the fact that I had found and recognized
a picture of my mother.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>When the family left Greenhurst, young Moreton, his college
mate and friend, remained at the old mansion with Mr. Upham,
who had up to this time been the tutor of both. The intimacy
that existed between these young men arose from the peculiar
relations that Moreton held toward the family. But for the
will which left Marston Court, with other property, to Lady
Jane, who afterward became the wife of Lord Clare, this young
man would have inherited everything that the old London banker
possessed, for he was his nephew and sole relative. Thus he
was in truth the natural heir of Marston Court and all the
wealth that had devolved on the earl by the sudden death of
his bride. Lord Clare left the country too much afflicted for
any thought of the wrong that had been done this young man,
but he had written to make liberal provision for his support
and education, placing him in all respects on a level with his
own nephew; and there was no just doubt that on Lord
Clare’s return to England, a portion at least of the inheritance
that had been swept from his hands by the fondness of an old
man for his wife, would be restored to him.</p>

<p class='c014'>With this just expectation, Henry Moreton remained at
Greenhurst, with the tutor, who had always been a greater
favorite with Lady Catherine than with the young men them
selves. Indeed, it was by her arrangement that these two persons,
so unequal in character, were left at the Hurst.</p>

<p class='c014'>Cora and I sometimes met young Moreton and his tutor in
our rambles, and occasionally they came for an hour to the
parsonage; but my preoccupation and a certain consciousness
of the shame that had been put upon me by his benefactress,
forbade that degree of intimacy with Moreton that might
naturally have sprung up between young persons thrown so
much together. But I hardly gave Moreton thought enough to
comprehend the very noble and beautiful traits of character
which, with one drawback, were in every way estimable. He
was very unlike Irving, with his prompt courage, his impetuous
feelings, and generous forgetfulness of self. Sensitive, and at
times almost timid, Moreton possessed few of those qualities
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>that inspire enthusiasm in a proud young heart like mine. The
extreme refinement and delicacy of his person and features
sometimes aroused my admiration; but in everything he was so
unlike my own idol, that I gave him nothing more than a kindly
place in my regard. As for Cora, she seldom spoke to him.
Though cheerful with every one else in his presence, she became
demure and thoughtful, like a bird with its wings folded.</p>

<p class='c014'>But Mr. Upham was not a man to awake measured feelings
of this kind.</p>

<p class='c014'>There certainly do exist persons endowed with intuitions so
keen that they seem gifts of prophecy, and guard the soul,
which but for them would be bruised and trampled under foot
by the rude multitude. Are these feelings the thoughts of our
guardian angels, the golden spears with which they hedge us
in from harm? I know not, but it is certain no evil-minded
being ever came near me that I did not feel a thrill of repulsion,
certainly as light springs from flame.</p>

<p class='c014'>True to this inward monitor, I never really liked this mild,
self-possessed tutor. In spite of his silky manners, my heart
always rose against him. It certainly seemed like a prejudice,
and I often tried to reason it away. No human being could
be kinder than this man; there was nothing noisy or unpleasant
about him; indeed, there existed persons who found his humility,
and deferential silence more attractive than the warm-hearted
sincerity of young Irving; but I was not among them.</p>

<p class='c014'>Nothing but the sensitive dislike that I felt for this man,
would have enabled me to understand the stealthy and subtle
advances which he made to obtain my regard. But though I
could not read his motive for wishing to interest a creature
isolated like myself, there was no mistaking his pertinacious
endeavors. Still he never spoke out; never, to use a worldly
term, committed himself in words, thus keeping my frank nature
at a disadvantage. There was no discouraging a man who
expressed himself only in tones, sighs and glances. But to a
heart wholly given up to another, there is nothing so repulsive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>as the covert attentions that hint at love, which you never have
the opportunity of receiving or crushing with a word.</p>

<p class='c014'>At another time I might not have noticed Mr. Upham so
closely, but in the listless state which follows the reaction of
strong excitement, I was fit only for observation and thoughtfulness;
besides, the fact that this man had been so long intimate
with Irving, gave him a sort of painful fascination for me.
Heart and brain I was a precocious girl, and the vigilance of
my observation might have befitted an older and wiser person.
Still I could not read him. Why did he wish to interest me?
Why was he constantly talking of me to Turner, and putting
Maria under cross-questions like a lawyer? Why, above all,
was he so cold toward Cora, she, so strangely beautiful, so full
of rustic coquetry, that a stoic must have yielded to her graceful
beauty?</p>

<p class='c014'>I had the discernment to see all that suggested these questions,
but lacked the power to answer them.</p>

<p class='c014'>It seemed to me, at times, that Cora felt and shared my dislike;
but after the events that followed Turner’s wedding, the
entire confidence that existed between us was, to a degree,
broken off. I never made her a confidant in those feelings that
filled my whole nature, and really regarded her as too much of
a child, notwithstanding our years were nearly the same, for
any curiosity regarding her girlish fancies or prejudices.</p>

<p class='c014'>Still, after a time, I could not fail to see that a change of
some kind had fallen upon her. More than once I observed
that her eyes were heavy as with crushed tears, and that
shadows lay under them sometimes for days together; but she
always burst into such passions of mocking gaiety when I grew
anxious about the cause, that I was overwhelmed by it.</p>

<p class='c014'>As the second year of Irving’s absence crept on, my heart
grew heavy with anxiety; I became suspicious of his faith,
restless, unhappy beyond my powers of explaining. I can now
trace back these feelings to looks, hints, and disjointed questions,
dropped, from time to time, by Upham, with a point that
stung like drops of venom, and yet with a seeming carelessness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>that had all the force of truth. But then I suffered greatly
without knowing from what source the distrust and anguish
came.</p>

<p class='c014'>One thing is very certain, the forced presence of this man, his
incessant attentions, accompanied with so much perseverance,
served to keep my sweet Cora at a distance from me that was
painful; but I could not force my pride to ask an explanation.
No sister ever more truly loved another than I loved her. There
was but one thing on earth I would not have sacrificed to her,
and that was so much dearer than my own soul, I could have
parted with one easily as the other.</p>

<p class='c014'>Thus, as I have said, two years went by. Then news came
that Lady Catherine and her son would soon be at Greenhurst.
Mr. Upham gave me this intelligence one night when I was
returning from the parsonage, where I had left Cora in a state
of sadness that pained me, but of which she would give no
explanation. “He was going that way in order to meet me,”
he said, and turned back in his usual quiet fashion as if to
escort me home. His eyes were fixed searchingly on my face
as he proclaimed his errand, and I felt that he was keenly
reading my countenance.</p>

<p class='c014'>But I had a strong will, and though the blood leaped in my
heart at the thought of seeing Irving again, it did not reach
my cheek or disturb a tone of my voice.</p>

<p class='c014'>“They will be welcome,” I said; “the place is but little
changed.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You are forgiving as an angel,” he answered. “That last
scene with Lady Catherine would have left any other heart full
of bitterness.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And who told you of that scene?” I questioned sharply,
and with a burning sense of shame.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Who? George Irving, of course. It sent him abroad a
whole year before the time allotted to him.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And he told you this?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Certainly, why not? Did you suppose me merely Irving’s
tutor?” he answered, with a strange smile.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>“Why, what else are you?” I demanded.</p>

<p class='c014'>“His friend—his confidant.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Something in his manner put me upon my guard that evening;,
and I was disinclined to continue the conversation; but he
was not a man to be evaded in anything. He followed up the
subject with pertinacity, and every time Irving’s name was mentioned
I felt his eyes penetrating to my very thoughts. As we
entered the park, I was about to turn down an avenue that
led to my home, but he laid one hand on my arm and gently
detained me.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Zana,” he said, “listen to me—for one moment throw off
this haughty reserve. It chills me—it is cruel, for you know
that I love you—love you, Zana, as man never loved woman.
Now before our little Eden is broken up by these haughty
Clares—now, while I have you all to myself, let me say it!”</p>

<p class='c014'>I looked at him in amazement. The words he had spoken
seemed like sacrilege; for, to a heart that really loves, there is
a sort of profanity in expressions of passion from other than the
true lips.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Zana—Zana, you are ice—you are marble—my words
freeze you—this is no answer to love like mine.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You have said truly,” I answered. “Ice, marble, anything
hard and cold is all the reply that I can give—and it is fitting,
for you love me no more than I love you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The man turned white and stammered forth,</p>

<p class='c014'>“You—you wrong me. Without love why should any man
seek to make you his wife?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“True,” I answered stung by his words—“true, there is
something here quite incomprehensible, but it is not love.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He broke into a passionate torrent of protestations, wrung
my hand in his, and even attempted to throw his arms around
me; but I retreated from him in dismay.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You will not believe me,” he said, standing in my path pale
and breathless. “You will not even believe that I love
you?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, I do not believe it!”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>“Who—who has poisoned your ear against me? Not that
canting priest; not—not”——</p>

<p class='c014'>“No one has ever uttered a word against you in my presence,”
I replied.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Perhaps not, but you are so positive—you may have been
impressed with some evil belief against me.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, I have never thought of the matter.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then you are truly indifferent?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am, indeed!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You have no regard for my feeling—no gratitude for the
love that I have lavished upon you so long. There is a cause
for this, and that cause is your love for George Irving.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He looked at me with malicious scrutiny, but I had expected
this, and my cheek remained cool as if he had passed an ordinary
compliment.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Inscrutable child,” he muttered, “will nothing reach you?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You are right,” I answered, without heeding his muttered
comment. “It is my love for George Irving that makes me
look upon all that you express as a wrong done to him, a
mockery of the true feeling that lives in my heart, as rich wine
fills a cup to the brim, leaving no space for a drop less pure
than itself.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Oh, how my soul shrunk from the smile which he turned
upon me.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Can you, vain girl—can you, for a moment, think that he
loves you?—you whom his uncle abandons and his mother
denounces?”</p>

<p class='c014'>The blood burned in my cheeks and temples hotly enough
now, but I answered proudly,</p>

<p class='c014'>“My thoughts like my affections are my own, I refuse to
share them.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He smiled again, derisively.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is this wild dream that makes you so haughty. Dream
on—I can wait!—when you awake, my homage may not seem
so paltry.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He left me abruptly, and for many minutes I stood watching
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>his dusky form as it wound slowly in and out among the chestnuts.
There was something serpentlike about his progress
that made me thoughtful.</p>

<p class='c014'>Why had this man sought me? Not from love, of that I was
assured. Was there anything in my last scene with Lady Catherine,
with which he had become acquainted, to arouse feelings
of ambition or interest in a nature like his? If not, where was I
to seek an explanation of his strange love-making? Now, for
the first time, for hitherto my pride had kept on the outskirts
of the question, I asked myself plainly why the picture of that
haunting face—the face, which, without proof, I knew to be
that of my mother—why it should have been found in Lord
Clare’s desk?</p>

<p class='c014'>With this question came others that made my heart quail
and my cheek burn. Memories thronged upon me—Lady
Catherine’s words as she urged Turner’s marriage—the half
uttered sentences of George Irving—the bitter dislike which
his mother evidently felt for me; all these thing crowded upon
my brain so close that conviction came like lightning flashes.
I was Lord Clare’s illegitimate child. My mother—great
heavens, how the thought of that face in all its heavenly
beauty burned in my brain! Amid sobs and tears, and a
bitter, bitter sense of degradation, my soul drew a black veil
over it, and turned away from a remembrance of its loveliness.</p>

<p class='c014'>I could not follow up the subject. Indeed, Mr. Upham was
overwhelmed in the feelings that rushed upon me. I forgot
to question his motives—forgot him—everything in the desolation
of my shame.</p>

<p class='c014'>I went home, but asked no questions either of Turner or his
wife. They could have explained nothing that I did not fully
comprehend, and my soul shrunk from the idea of speaking out
its shame in words.</p>

<p class='c014'>Now all rest forsook me. I had a craving wish to know
everything—to penetrate into the centre of my parents’ secret,
but felt all the time that it was useless, as painful to inquire.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>The whole history was locked up in my own soul. I felt its
weight there, but the struggle to drag it forth strained my
whole being to no avail.</p>

<p class='c014'>Then my conjectures began, as at first, to wander over that
which was probable. Could George Irving continue to love
a creature so disgraced—a wretched offshoot from his own
proud ancestral tree? And if he did, where was the end,
marriage? No, no, my own pride rose up in defence of his!
Where, then? Oh, how dead my heart lay as I asked the
question.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXXVIII.<br> <span class='large'>THE HAZELNUT HEDGE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>In a week Lady Catherine and her son arrived, but I had
lost all desire to see them. Turner found no difficulty now
in persuading me to keep in-doors. But George never sought
me. I knew that Greenhurst rang with gaiety; that Estelle
Canfield, with many other fair patricians, was filling its stately
rooms with mirth and beauty, but I was forgotten. It seemed
to me at times, that my heart would break. The roundness
melted from my limbs; the bloom was slowly quenching itself
on my cheeks; my orphanage had never been complete till then.</p>

<p class='c014'>But Cora was left to me—the pet and darling of my life.
I was still the same to her, and she was more gentle and more
lovely than ever. To my surprise, the return of company to
Greenhurst made little impression upon her. The girlish curiosity
and excitement which had formerly annoyed me seemed
extinguished in her nature. Indeed she became rather more
sad than usual; and I often found her sitting alone, and so
still, under the cypress tree, where her father had leaned on
that funeral day.</p>

<p class='c014'>It did not seem strange to me, this quiet sadness, thus harmonizing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>with the sorrow that dashed all joy from my own life.
At another time I should have remarked it, but now it appeared
natural as night tears do to the violet.</p>

<p class='c014'>To Mr. Clarke I sometimes opened a leaf of my heart; but
only to reveal the shadows that lay there, in abstract musings
and mournful questions. At such times he soothed me with
his sweet, Christian counsel, that left tears like dew upon every
blossom of my nature. Thus I became day by day, more
closely knitted to this good man and his child; and the girlish
love that had been so strong merged itself into the still deeper
affections of my opening womanhood. I loved them—how I
loved them the reader will hereafter know!</p>

<p class='c014'>One day, I was returning home about sunset, and alone.
There was a footpath that shortened the distance across the
meadows which lay between the village and Greenhurst, and
I threaded it wearily, as one walks who has no object. The
path led through the hazel thicket where my arm had been
wounded. After clambering the wall I sat down among the
bushes, weary, and so depressed that I longed to hide myself
in their shelter even from the daylight.</p>

<p class='c014'>I put back the lace that flowed from the short sleeves of my
dress, and looked, through rushing tears, at the tiny white spot
which the wound had left upon my arm. It was scarcely
larger than a pearl, and to me infinitely more precious, for it
came from him. It marked the reality of those love words that
lay, even then, glowing in the bottom of my heart.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was all over. He had gone his way in the world. I—yes,
I must go mine; for to remain there in my dear old home
with him so near, and yet so far away, was killing me.</p>

<p class='c014'>I sobbed aloud; it was not often that weeping did me much
good, but everything was so still—and I grew so miserably
childish that the tears fell from my eyes like rain. A thrush
lighted on a branch close by, and with his pretty head turned
on one side, seemed regarding me with compassion. I thought
of the lark’s nest, where, a child, I had slept so close to death,
and wished, oh, how truly, that God had taken me then.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>While I sat thus lost in sorrow, a gush of wind swept
through the thicket, and I heard some one wading through the
tall, red clover tops, shaking off their sweetness upon the air I
breathed.</p>

<p class='c014'>I shrunk back, ashamed of my tears, ashamed to be seen.
But the steps approached steadily towards the wall, and I sat
by the path, breathless, still hoping that the hazel branches
would conceal me.</p>

<p class='c014'>But the steps diverged a little, and the thicket was parted
just before me. My breath came back in a sob. I concealed
my eyes with both hands, and cowered back among the bushes.</p>

<p class='c014'>He paused. I heard a faint exclamation, and then—then
I began to sob and tremble. He was at my side half-stooping,
half-kneeling; his arm was around me. With one hand he drew
down mine and looked into my face.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Zana—Zana!”</p>

<p class='c014'>I looked up and smiled.</p>

<p class='c014'>“My poor Zana,” he said, “you have suffered—you look ill—how
is this? They told me that you were happy.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, <em>so</em> happy,” I replied, yielding myself for one moment
to the clasp of his arm—“so happy that it is killing me.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Killing you,” he said, laying one hand softly upon my
head, and putting it back that he might see the face so
changed since we met last. “In solemn truth, I believe it is;
how strangely you look, Zana, how much older—how full of
soul—how worn with feeling!”</p>

<p class='c014'>I remembered why this change had been—who and where
I was. What right had he, George Irving, of Greenhurst,
with his arm around the illegitimate child of his uncle? No
wonder his proud mother despised me—her insults were natural—but
this tenderness, these looks of love—this caressing arm—what
insult could she offer so burning as that?</p>

<p class='c014'>The fire of this thought flashed through my veins. I sprang
up and cast his arm away.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You have no right—I do not belong to you—never can—never,
never!” I exclaimed. “You know it, and yet do this!”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>“I did not believe it before, not wholly, not entirely—the
suspicion was too dreadful,” he answered, turning white. “I
will not believe it even yet, till your lips utter it in words.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why should I? You know that it is true—that a barrier
of iron rests between your love and mine.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is enough!” he answered, turning still more deathly pale.
“Zana, it is enough—you have stung me to the soul.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I have not imparted to you any portion of my shame,” I
answered with bitter tears.</p>

<p class='c014'>He started as if a viper had stung him.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Your shame, Zana!—your shame! Speak out, girl—if
another had said that word!”——</p>

<p class='c014'>We both started. He broke off sharply. Upham had crept,
unseen, close to his elbow.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Ha, Irving—so you have found the truant in her nest!
Hasn’t she grown to be a bird of Paradise, but sly as ever;
aint you, Zana?”</p>

<p class='c014'>I stood in astonishment gazing at him, without uttering a
word. This audacity took away my breath.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I have just come from the parsonage,” he continued, with
a quiet smile, addressing George. “My bird of birds had
flown, but I left the beautiful Cora waiting with great impatience.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Irving gave me a look that made me almost cry out—turned,
leaped the wall with a single bound, and left me alone with
that reptile.</p>

<p class='c014'>He looked after George with a smile that died coldly on his
lips beneath my searching glance.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What is this?” I questioned, “your manner has changed,
sir. It insults—it offends me!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What, you are angry because I have driven away that boyish
profligate,” he answered; “the lover of Cora, the betrothed
of Estelle.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is false,” I cried, full of indignation.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Ask Lady Catherine!” he replied.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I will ask himself,” I answered.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>“Then you have promised another meeting; it will be a good
excuse. But let me warn you, a second private appointment
of this kind may reach Lady Catherine. I have but to drop a
hint even now, and you are driven ignominiously from the
estate; while he—perhaps you have forgotten that but for the
bounty of his uncle and Lady Catherine Irving—he is a
beggar.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Oh, how the wretch tortured me! I felt every word he spoke
like the touch of cold iron.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Let me pass, I would go home,” I said, faint with anger
and disgust.</p>

<p class='c014'>He stepped aside, smiling coldly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But first,” I said, pausing, “you spoke of Cora, my friend,
my sister, and of him—this must be explained.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I have said my say,” was his cold answer.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then I will ask him!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Of course he will confess all. It is so natural to urge a
suit with one lady, while you make her the confidant of your
love for another. Really your village beauties know how to
deal with men who have learned morality in Paris, and love-making
at Vienna.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But I will tell Cora of this slander.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He smiled.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Is it slander to say that a pretty angel like Cora Clark has
captivated a roving young fellow of Irving’s taste?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But it is untrue—I will question her.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I have a great idea of unsophisticated innocence, village
simplicity, and all that, Miss Zana, but really permit me to
doubt if Miss Cora Clark makes you the confidant of her little
love affairs.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“She has none, she never had,” I exclaimed, with jealous
anger.</p>

<p class='c014'>He laughed again. The sound stung me like an arrow. I
turned away, sprang over the wall, and walked along the footpath
back to the parsonage. My progress grew slower and
slower as I fell into thought, for a remembrance of the change
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>in Cora’s manner oppressed me. I came in sight of the parlor
window. The glow of Cora’s golden hair shone through the
dusky green of the ivy leaves as she leaned out, shading her
eyes with one hand as if to be certain that she saw aright.
She drew back, and directly after I caught a glimpse of
some male figure gliding around a corner of the church rapidly,
as if to avoid observation. The figure was too slight for Mr.
Clark, and at first I strove to convince myself that it might be
Upham himself, who had outwalked me, concealed by a hedge
that ran near and parallel with the footpath; but I cast the
suspicion from me. The coldness which had uniformly marked
his acquaintance with my beautiful girl forbade it.</p>

<p class='c014'>I entered the little parlor, panting, but resolute. Cora rose
to receive me, a good deal flushed, and with a look about the
eyes as if she had been agitated and weeping. She did not
ask the reason of my sudden return, but fixed her blue eyes
with a look of affright on my face, as if prepared for, and
dreading what I was about to say.</p>

<p class='c014'>At the time, this did not strike me, but in after days I
remembered it well.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Cora,” I said, disarmed by the look of trouble on her sweet
face—“Cora, my sister, tell me, who was it that just left you?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why do you ask?—No one—no one has left the cottage.
You—you found me alone!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And have you been alone all the time since I went away?”
I inquired.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I—I—not quite, my father was here. But why do you
ask such questions?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Her eyes filled, and her sweet lips began to tremble, as they
always did when grieved, since she was a little child.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Tell me one thing, Cora, was it any one from Greenhurst
that I just saw going round the church.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You saw him then,” she said, turning pale, and sinking to
her chair. “Oh, Zana!”</p>

<p class='c014'>I too sunk upon a chair, and we sat gazing into each other’s
pale face till both burst into tears.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXXIX.<br> <span class='large'>MY FATHER’S RETURN.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>No human being can comprehend the desolation, the heart
sickness, that seized upon me after this interview with Cora.
Nothing had been explained between us. I had looked in her
face, and saw it bathed with tears and guilty blushes, from
which my very soul shrunk back. My love for that girl was so
true, so deep—my love for him—it was like uprooting the life
within me, the agony of bitter conviction that he was trifling
with me—with her perhaps. But the very intensity of my sorrow
made me calm, nay, even kind to her. I think at that
moment she would have confided in me entirely, had I urged it,
for she was deeply moved—but I could not do it! For worlds
I would not have heard the details of his miserable perfidy;
they would have driven me mad.</p>

<p class='c014'>My faith in human goodness, which had hitherto been to me
like a religion, was from this time broken up. I was adrift on
the world, full of doubt, terror, and contempt. Cora, George—where
could I look for truth? The wickedness of Lady Catherine
seemed noble compared to theirs.</p>

<p class='c014'>I had no other friends, save the two kind hearts in my own
home, and there I fled for shelter as a wounded bird to his nest.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is said that there is no real love unless respect for its
object composes the greater share; but is it a truth? Is it
the worthy and good on whom our affections are most lavishly
bestowed? The history of every-day life tells us no—the history
of my own heart answers no. Amid all the bitter feelings
that tortured me, love for the two beings that had wronged me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>most was still strong in my soul, a pang and curse, but vital as
ever.</p>

<p class='c014'>With all my apparent and real frankness, there was a power
of suppression in my nature that no one would have believed.
With regard to my own feelings I was always reserved and
silent, they were too sacred for every-day handling, and nothing
but the inspiration of some generous impulse, or the idea that
I could have sensations to be ashamed of, ever won me to confess
anything of that inner life which was both my heaven and
my torment. Oh, what torment it proved then!</p>

<p class='c014'>But I was of a nature “to suffer and be strong.” Self-centred
in my desperate anguish I went on in life, giving out
no visible sign by which those two beings who loved me, Turner
and Maria, could guess that I had been so deceived.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was well that I had this strength, that the springs of life
within me were both elastic and powerful, for the great battle
of existence had but just commenced. I had been aroused to
a knowledge of the feebleness and falsehood of others; soon I
was to learn how much of evil lay sleeping in my own nature.</p>

<p class='c014'>One night Turner came home earlier than usual, and in a
tumult of excitement that we had seldom witnessed in him
before.</p>

<p class='c014'>He came to my little room, where I now spent all the day.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Zana, Zana,” he said, drawing me toward him, “come
hither, I have something to tell you—I have news.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What news?” I inquired, with a pang, for it seemed to me
that Cora and Irving must have something to do with a subject
that could so interest the old man. “I—I am not fond of
news, Turner. Nothing good ever comes to me now.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“God only knows, child, whether it is for good or for evil,
but Lord Clare is in England! On his way even now to
Greenhurst.”</p>

<p class='c014'>My heart swelled. I felt the blood leaving my lips; my
hands grew cold as ice.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Turner,” I said, wringing his withered hand in mine—“Turner,
is Lord Clare my father?”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>His small eyes opened large and wide. The wrinkles deepened
on his face like lines upon a map. My question took him
by surprise.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I would give ten years of my life, Zana, to say yes or no
with certainty.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then you cannot tell me,” I cried, cruelly disappointed.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, if I could—if I only could, all might yet end well with
you, poor child. But there is no proof—I am not certain
myself. How then will it be in my power to convince him?
If you could but remember. You were six or seven years old
when we found you, Zana, and at that age, a child has many
memories—but you had none.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, one—I remember <em>her</em> face.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But nothing more?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, nothing. To attempt anything more wrenches all my
faculties, and brings forth shadows only.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“This is always the answer. What can I do?” muttered the
old man, “resemblances are no proof, and I am not sure of
that. Zana, have you the least idea how Lord Clare looks?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes,” I answered, “for I have seen his portrait.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“There again,” muttered the old man—“there again, at
every turn I am blocked out. But that other face, what is it
like?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Dark, sad; great flashing eyes full of fire, but black as
midnight; hair like the folds of a storm-cloud; a mouth—but
how can I describe it, so full of tender sorrow, so tremulous?
Tell me, is this like my mother? Was she thus, or not?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is too vague, I cannot tell.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But I have seen it, not flashing thus, but real, every feature
still; it was only one glimpse, but I knew that it was
her.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Where did you see this? Long since and living?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, it was a picture, at Greenhurst; I took it from an old
cabinet of black wood carved all over and rough with jewels.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Where is it now—that picture?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Lady Catherine has it—she snatched it from me.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>“But you knew the face?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, I knew the face.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“This is something, but not enough,” said Turner, thoughtfully.
“Still if his heart speaks for us”——</p>

<p class='c014'>I laid one hand on my bosom, for it swelled with painful
force.</p>

<p class='c014'>“My heart is speaking now,” I said. “If he is my father,
God will send an answer.”</p>

<p class='c014'>As I spoke, the sound of distant bells came sweeping through
the trees, and we heard the faint murmurs of a shout, as if people
at a great distance were rejoicing together.</p>

<p class='c014'>“He has come. It is from the village,” said Turner, and
tears rolled down his cheeks. “My boy—my boy, God bless
him. Will you not say God bless him, Zana?”</p>

<p class='c014'>I could not answer; every clash of the bells seemed to strike
against my heart. I knew it was my father that was coming;
but when Turner asked me to bless him, that face came before
me, and <em>I could not do it</em>.</p>

<p class='c014'>Turner left me, for the state of excitement in which those
bells had thrown him allowed of nothing but action. He followed
no path, but I saw him running at full speed across the
park, as if the weight of twenty, not sixty-five years, went with
him. Directly, and while the sunset was yet red in the west, I
heard the sound of carriage wheels and the swell of dying
shouts, as if the villagers had followed their lord up to the
lodge-gate. Then all grew still, save the faint sound of wheels,
the rustle of a thousand trees, that seemed to carry off the
shout amid the sighing of their leaves.</p>

<p class='c014'>I could not rest, for thought was pain. I wandered about
the house, and at length went down stairs in search of Maria.
She sat in the little breakfast-room, surrounded by the twilight;
and as I entered softly, the sound of her weeping filled
the room.</p>

<p class='c014'>I stole to her side, and sitting down at her feet, laid my
head on her lap, excited beyond endurance, but with no power
to weep.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>She passed her hand softly down my hair, and sobbed more
passionately than before.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What are you crying for? Everybody else seems happy.
Only you and Turner receive the Lord of Greenhurst with
tears,” I said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“We parted from him with tears,” she answered, sobbing
afresh.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You knew him well then, ma bonne?” I said, plunging into
the subject recklessly now that it was commenced.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Knew him well?” she answered; then breaking into Spanish,
she murmured among her tears, “too well—too well for him
or for us.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She took my face between her hands, and gazed down upon
it with mournful tenderness.</p>

<p class='c014'>“My bird,” she murmured, “ask me no questions about the
earl—my heart is full to-night. It is not you that sits at my
feet, but another—another. Oh, what became of her?—what
became of her? More than ten years, and we have no answer
to give him.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“That person—she who sits in my place overshadows me in
your heart—is it my mother?” I questioned, in a whisper.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The God of heaven only knows!” she answered passionately.
“Do not question me, child, for the sound of those bells has
unlocked sad memories—I have no control over myself—I shall
say forbidden things. Hush, hush, let me listen.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I kept my head upon her lap, brooding in silence over her
words. I could wait, but a stern determination to know all, to
solve the mysteriousness that surrounded me, filled my being. I
thirsted for entire knowledge regarding myself, and resolved to
wrench it from its keepers, whatever pain it might bring or give.</p>

<p class='c014'>But after Maria had wept awhile, she grew calm and circumspect.
I could feed my craving with no more of her passionate
outbreaks. We sat together till deep in the night, conversing
in abrupt snatches, but I gathered nothing from what she said
to confirm my suspicion that at least a portion of my history
was in her keeping.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>Turner did not come back that night, nor till deep in the
next morning. When he did appear it was with a step of lead,
and with trouble in his heavy eyes. Maria met him at the
door, and a few hasty words passed between them before he
entered.</p>

<p class='c014'>As they came in I heard her say, as if repeating the word
after him, “dying! not that—oh, not that!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It has killed him at last—I knew it—I foresaw it from the
first,” answered Turner, bitterly. “The fiends—would to
heaven they had all been smothered in their holes before
he”——</p>

<p class='c014'>“Hush, hush,” said Maria, “not a word against her. If he
is dying—what may her fate have been?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“God forgive me, I was wrong—but there is a sight up
yonder, Maria, that would draw tears from marble. But,
Zana, where is she?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Has he spoken of it? Has he inquired?” asked Maria,
quickly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“He asked only one question—if she was found, nothing
more.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And you spoke of Zana?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, of what use would it be? I have no right to torture
him with bare suspicions; but the girl—let him see her—if his
heart does not speak then, we never must.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“She will not refuse—you always judge rightly,” was Maria’s
mild rejoinder. “Must I go with her?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, let her come alone. Go, tell her.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I came forward and put my arm through that of the old
man. He drew back, held me at a distance with both hands,
and pondered over every feature of my face, as if his life had
depended on perusing them correctly. At last he drew me
gently toward him, and smoothed my hair with his palms.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Zana,” he said, “you are a woman now—be firm and still;
whatever you see, do not give way.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I will not; guide, and I shall follow steadily.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Lady Catherine is at Greenhurst,” he said.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>“I know it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“She forbids you to come; she threatens me if I attempt to
bring you to Lord Clare. Have you courage to follow me
against her orders?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And her son’s, should he urge them on me?”</p>

<p class='c014'>My words came like lead, but I answered, “yes,” to that
also.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But will you do more than that for my sake, Zana? Will
you steal in privately and avoid them all?”</p>

<p class='c014'>I could not answer at first. The mere thought of entering
that stately dwelling was hateful; but to enter it stealthily like
the thief that woman had called me, was too much. Unconsciously
I recoiled.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Zana, Lord Clare cannot live many days. If he dies without
seeing you, all is lost—will you come? Will you be guided
once—only this once by old Turner?”</p>

<p class='c014'>I remembered all that he had done for me, all his beautiful
integrity of character, and blushed for the hesitation which
seemed like distrust.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am ready to follow you now, and always,” I said. “Tell
me what to do, and I will obey.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Thank you, child,” said the old man. “Come at once, in
the dress you have on. Lady Catherine has gone out to drive—if
she returns before we leave, have no fear, I shall be with
you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I threw a mantle over my dress, and went out, keeping up
with Turner, who walked on rapidly, and absorbed in thought.
We entered the back door over the very steps upon which the
old man had found me ten years ago. He seemed to remember
it, for as I crossed the threshold he turned and reached forth
his hand as if to help me along. His heart was busy with
the past. One could see that very plainly, for he gave a little
start as I took his hand, and turned a sort of apologizing smile
upon me, and I saw tears steal one by one into his eyes, as he
pressed my hand and drew me forward. We threaded the hall,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>and mounted the massive oak staircase without encountering
even a servant. Then Turner clasped my hand tighter, as if
to give me courage, and led me rapidly through several vast
chambers, till we came to a closed door at which he paused.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Step into that window and hide yourself behind the curtains,”
he whispered.</p>

<p class='c014'>I went at once, and when he saw the heavy crimson silk
sweep over me, Turner knocked lightly at the door.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was opened by young Morton, who stepped out and spoke
in a whisper.</p>

<p class='c014'>“He has been inquiring for you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“That is well,” answered Turner, “you can leave him entirely
now and get some rest—I will take your place.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Thank you. I have just ordered some fruit—you will find
it on the tray yonder,” said Morton, evidently glad to be
relieved.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, yes, I will attend to it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>As he spoke, Turner followed the young man into the next
room, watching him as he walked down the long perspective of
a neighboring gallery.</p>

<p class='c014'>When certain that he was quite alone, the old man came to
the window and stepped behind the drapery. He was very
pale, and I saw by the nervous motion of his hands that he was
subduing his agitation with difficulty.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Zana,” he whispered, huskily, “I am going in; after a
little, follow me with the fruit you will find yonder. Bring it
in, quietly, as if you were one of the people. Then obey my
directions as they would? Do you comprehend?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Perfectly,” I whispered, trembling from head to foot, but
resolute to act.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Now God be with us!” he ejaculated, wringing my hand.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Amen!” trembled on my lip, but I could not speak.</p>

<p class='c014'>He left me and entered the chamber. I waited a moment,
holding one hand over my heart, which frightened me with its
strange beating. Then I stepped forth and looked around the
room. It was a sort of ante-chamber, large and richly furnished,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>but somewhat in disorder, as if lately used. Upon
a marble table in one corner stood some crystal flasks ruby
with wine, and with them a small silver basket full of fruit,
with a vase of flowers crowded close to it.</p>

<p class='c014'>Even then the rude way in which these exquisite objects were
huddled together wounded my sense of the beautiful; and with
my trembling hands I hastily arranged the fruit, mingled
snowy and golden flowers with the rich glow of the cherries,
and shaded the strawberries with cool green leaves. As I
gathered a handful of creamy white raspberries in the centre of
the basket with trembling haste, Turner opened the door and
looked out. His face, so pale and anxious, startled me, and I
almost let the basket fall.</p>

<p class='c014'>He closed the door, and nerving myself I lifted the fruit
again and carried it forward. One moment’s pause and I
went in.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XL.<br> <span class='large'>ONCE MORE AT GREENHURST.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>It was a large chamber, full of rich, massive furniture. The
windows were all muffled with waves of crimson silk, and I
found myself in the hazy twilight they created, dizzy and
blinded by a rush of emotions that it seemed impossible for me
to control. After a little, the haze cleared from my vision,
and I saw before me a tall man, attenuated almost to a shadow,
sitting in a great easy-chair with his eyes closed, as if asleep.</p>

<p class='c014'>I looked at him with a strained and eager gaze. His head
rested on a cushion of purple silk, and a quantity of soft, fair
locks, so lightly threaded with silver, that, in the rich twilight
of the room, all traces of it were lost, lay scattered over it, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>the purple glowing through. The face was like marble, pure and
as white, but with dusky shadows all around the eyes, and a
burning red in the cheeks that made me shudder. A Turkish
dressing-gown of Damascus silk, spotted with gold and lined
with emerald green, lay wrapped around his wasted figure. His
hands were folded in the long Oriental sleeves, and I could
see the crimson waves over his chest rise and fall rapidly with
his sharp and frequent respiration.</p>

<p class='c014'>I stood beside him unnoticed, for my footsteps had fallen
upon the richly piled carpet lightly as an autumn leaf. The
basket shook in my hands, for my limbs knocked together, and
the perspiration started upon my arms and forehead. But I
made no sound, forced back the tears that struggled in my
heart, and stood waiting for what might befall.</p>

<p class='c014'>Lord Clare turned feebly on his cushion, and let one pale
hand fall down from his bosom.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Turner,” he said, in a faint, low voice, “did I not ask for
something?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, my lord—some fruit. It is here.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I approached. Lord Clare opened his eyes—those wild,
blue eyes, and turned them full upon me.</p>

<p class='c014'>I could no longer bear my weight, my limbs gave way, and I
fell upon one knee, holding up the basket between my shaking
hands.</p>

<p class='c014'>Turner drew close to my side, holding his breath and trembling.</p>

<p class='c014'>Lord Clare did not touch the fruit, but fell slowly back on
the cushion with his great burning eyes upon my face.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Turner,” he said at last, sitting upright and speaking in
quick gasps—“Turner, what is this? Who is she?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I do not know,” answered the old man, “we found her on
the door-step years ago. Be tranquil, Master Clarence. If
she is the one we have sought for, there is no proof but those
eyes—that face.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Lord Clare reached out his arms, and tears smothered the
painful gaze of his eyes.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>“Aurora,” he said, in a voice of such tenderness that my
tears followed it, “forgive me before I die.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Turner clasped his hands and held them up toward heaven,
trembling like withered leaves, while tears rolled silently down
his cheeks.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You know, Master Clarence, it cannot be herself.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Lord Clare turned his eyes from me to Turner, then lifting
one pale hand up to his forehead, he settled it over his eyes,
and directly great drops came starting from between the fingers.
A feeble shudder passed over his frame, and he murmured plaintively,
“No, it is her child, our child. But where is she?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I never learned,” answered Turner, sadly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Ask her, I cannot.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is useless, my lord, she knows nothing!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“She must—she must—my child was six years old. At that
age children know everything,” he answered eagerly, “and Zana
was very forward, my bright Zana.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He looked at me, till I shrunk from the feverish glow of his
eyes. At last he spoke, and my very heart trembled beneath
the sweet pathos of his voice.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Zana, where is your mother? Tell me, child; I cannot die
till she has spoken to me again.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I bowed down my face, and answered only with bitter sobs.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Is she dead? Is Aurora dead that you weep, but cannot
speak?” he questioned, faintly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Alas! I do not know!” was my agonized reply.</p>

<p class='c014'>“My child—Zana—and not know of her mother’s fate!
what unnatural thing is this?” he cried, burying his face in the
long sleeves of his gown. “This child is not my daughter,
Turner; Aurora’s child could not have forgotten her mother
thus.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I struggled with myself—from my innermost soul I called on
God to help me—to give me back the six years of life that had
been wrested from my brain. My temples throbbed; my limbs
shook with the effort; it seemed as if I were going mad.</p>

<p class='c014'>Lord Clare lifted his face; his eyes swam in tears; his pale
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>lips trembled. Laying both hands on my head, he spoke to me
again—spoke so tenderly I thought my heart must break before
he had done.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Zana—my daughter—my poor, lost child, what has come
over you? Do not be frightened—do not tremble so. Look
up in my face—let me see your eyes fully. Turner, they are
<em>her</em> eyes, my heart answers to them, oh, how mournfully. Zana,
I am your father—you should know that, altered as I am, for
men do not change like children. There, love, there, stop crying;
calm yourself. I have but one wish on earth now, and
that depends on you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“On me?” I gasped.</p>

<p class='c014'>“On you, my darling. Listen, I call you darling, does not
the old word bring back some memory?”</p>

<p class='c014'>He looked beseechingly in my face, waiting for a reply that
I could not give. My head drooped forward, bowed down with
the anguish of my imbecility.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is sweet—it thrills my heart to the centre,” I said,
mournfully.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And awakes some memory? You remember it as something
heard and loved, far, far back in the past. Is it not so?”</p>

<p class='c014'>I shook my head.</p>

<p class='c014'>He bent forward, wound his arms lovingly around me, and,
drawing me upward to his bosom, kissed my forehead.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And this,” he said, folding me to his heart so close that I
could feel every sharp pulsation. “Is there nothing familiar
now?—nothing that reminds you of an old stone balcony, full
of flowers, and a bright little thing leaping to her father’s
bosom; and she, that wronged woman, so darkly beautiful,
looking on? Child, my Aurora’s child, is there no memory
like this in your soul now?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“This tenderness has filled my heart with tears, I can find
nothing else there,” I answered, sadly.</p>

<p class='c014'>He unfolded his arms, and they dropped down, loose and
helpless, like broken willow-branches, and the quick panting of
his bosom made me shudder with a thought that he was dying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>I arose, and then he started upright in his chair, and fixed his
flashing eyes upon me.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Is this creature mine or not?” he said—“Aurora’s daughter
or a mockery? Am I accursed among the children of the
earth for one wrong act? Will this mystery walk with me to
the grave? Am I a father, or childless? Girl, answer me—wring
the truth from that brain! Before God I must know it,
or death will not be rest. Your mother, Zana—where is your
mother?”</p>

<p class='c014'>His voice rang sharp and clear through the chamber, filling
it like the scream of a wounded bird. His eyes were wild; his
cheeks hueless. I cowered back, chilled to the soul by his last
words. The room disappeared—everything grew white, and
shuddering with cold I felt, as it were, snow drifts rushing over
me, and through their paralyzing whiteness came the cry,</p>

<p class='c014'>“Your mother, Zana, where is your mother?”</p>

<p class='c014'>How long this lasted I do not know, but my next remembrance
was of sitting upon the carpet, faint, and with a stunned
feeling, as if some one had given me a heavy blow. A silver
basket lay upturned by my side, and a mass of crimson fruit,
matted with flowers, lay half among the frosted silver, half
upon the carpet.</p>

<p class='c014'>The room was still as death, save the short, painful sound of
some one breathing near me. I struggled to my feet, and sat
down in a great easy-chair which stood close by me. Then, as
my sight cleared, I saw that a window had been opened, that
the drapery was flung back from a massive ebony bedstead, and
upon the white counterpane I saw Lord Clare lying among the
folds of his gorgeous dressing-gown, pale and motionless as
marble.</p>

<p class='c014'>Turner stood over him, bathing his forehead, white almost as
the sick man.</p>

<p class='c014'>I arose and would have approached the bed, but Turner
waved me back, and I left the room, sick to the very heart’s
core.</p>

<p class='c014'>I met some persons in the galleries, but passed on without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>noticing them. As I reached the lower hall, Lady Catherine
Irving came in at the front entrance, apparently just from her
carriage.</p>

<p class='c014'>“How is this?” she said, turning pale with rage. “Who
permitted this? How came the girl here?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Her words had no effect upon me; the miserable preoccupation
of my soul rendered them harmless. I went by her without
answering, and left the house.</p>

<p class='c014'>“See that the creature is never admitted again; I will discharge
the servant who lets her in,” she continued, following me
to the door.</p>

<p class='c014'>I took no heed, but remembered her words afterward.</p>

<p class='c014'>I wandered off in the woods, for the very thought of the
close air of a house maddened me. Reflect I did not; a chaos
of wild thoughts and wilder feelings possessed me.</p>

<p class='c014'>At last I found myself on the eminence which I have described
more than once, from which a view of Marston Court
could be obtained. The strange man whom I had met there,
years ago, came to my mind; and, singular as it may seem, I
thought of him with a sort of hope which grew into a desire
for his presence.</p>

<p class='c014'>I thought of my father, for not a doubt arose within me that
Lord Clare was my father—of the agonizing darkness which
hung over his death-bed—of the inability which prevented me
sweeping that darkness aside. What was the mysterious thread
which lay upon my faculties? What human power could ever
unloose it?</p>

<p class='c014'>I looked around in anguish of heart. Was there no help?
I would pray to God, humble myself like a little child at his
feet, that he might mercifully enlighten me. There was hope
here, and I knelt down upon the turf, bowing my face in silence
before God. The effort composed me; it hastened the natural
reaction which must follow any intense excitement, and in my
motionless position I became calmer.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XLI.<br> <span class='large'>MY STRANGE VISITOR.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>All at once, I felt a hand laid on my shoulder, and, starting
up, saw the strange man by my side.</p>

<p class='c014'>He was little changed. The same picturesque combination
of rich colors soiled and rudely flung together, composed his
garments; the same sharp glitter made me shrink from a full
glance of his eyes. When he smiled, I saw that his teeth were
even and white as ever.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Zana, get up; you need me, and I am here.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I do need some one; but who can help me?” I said
despondingly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I can!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, God alone can give me what I want!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And what is that, Zana?” he said, smiling.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Light, memory. I would know who and what I am!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, child, that is easy!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“To God, truly—but to him alone.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But why do you want this knowledge now more than
formerly?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“My father is dying in anguish from this want!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Your father—and who is he?” was the abrupt question
with which he answered this.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I know, but have not the right to tell!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But how came you by the knowledge?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“My heart lay, for a little time, against his, and they understood
each other. I knew that the same blood beat in both,
certainly as if an angel had told me, I want no other evidence,”
was my prompt answer.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And you crave this knowledge in proof, that it may render
his death easy?”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>“Yes!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And for no other reason?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“That I may know myself and those who gave me life, that
is all!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But Lord Clare is rich!” said the man, fixing his keen
eyes upon me. “Did you think of that?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I did not mention Lord Clare,” was my answer, given in
astonishment at the reckless way in which he handled my
secret.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But you were thinking of him, and that he would have
money to give a child proven to be his!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, I never thought of it—never shall think of it!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“There is no Rommany in that,” he muttered, “the blood
does not speak there.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Then speaking louder, he addressed me, pointing toward
Marston Court.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Look,” he said, fastening his wild eyes on my face, “that
is a fine estate, and not tied up like Greenhurst to legal heirs;
Lord Clare’s daughter might get that if she had proof of her
birth before the earl dies. Had this nothing to do with your
anxiety just now?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Nothing,” I replied, with a touch of scorn. “I do not want
that estate, or any other.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Fool!” sneered the man; “if I believed you, the secret were
not worth telling!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What secret?” I inquired, breathlessly; “can <em>you</em> tell me
anything of my mother?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And if I did, what then?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I would worship you!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, as she did,” he answered, with a sort of mournful fierceness
in his eyes and voice.</p>

<p class='c014'>“As who did?” I demanded.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Your mother, Aurora.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“That was what he called her.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Who?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It was the name my father used!”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>“Ha! the murderer! how dare he?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But you know something of my mother!” I said eagerly;
“tell it me!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“That you may give Lord Clare the knowledge he thirsts
for?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You shall have this knowledge—he shall have it—and may
it crush him down, down”——</p>

<p class='c014'>“Stay!” I cried out, seizing his uplifted arm, “I will not
listen—it is my father you curse.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“<em>Your</em> father—I know it; but what was he to her?—to
Aurora?—what was he to her? What was she to him?”</p>

<p class='c014'>A flood of burning shame rushed over my face, and my eyes
fell beneath the lurid scorn of his.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Can you know this and not hate the traitorous gentile?” he
said.</p>

<p class='c014'>I covered my burning face, but could not answer.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Look up! the fire of your Caloe blood is burning to waste;
it should hurl vengeance on those who have heaped shame on it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What, on my father?” I cried, struck with horror—“he is
dying!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And without proof that you are his child?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Alas! yes.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“He shall have it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Give it me now, now,” I cried, in eager joy.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No; let him writhe a little longer—revenge should be
eaten slowly—you must learn this—the blow that kills at once
makes a gourmand of the avenger—he swallows all at a mouthful.”</p>

<p class='c014'>There was something fiendish in the man’s look as he said
this, that made me shudder as I faltered out,
“You terrify me—I do not understand. Will you tell me
of my mother?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I will give you the knowledge soon.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, now, that it may bless his last moments,” I pleaded;
“he may not live another hour.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>“That it may curse him,” shouted the man. “But that I
am sure of it, he might die like a dog, in his ignorance. Not
for all those lands which the secret shall bring you, child, would
I speak, only I know how sweet my words will be to him,” he
cried, pointing toward Greenhurst. “Choke back those tears,
little one; it is time you were among us, full time.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But my mother—speak of her—you terrify me.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, I forget,” he said, with a sudden change of manner,
“there is gentile blood in your cheeks, and that is cowardly;
but what I have to say will fire it up by and by, Zana,” he
continued, with a touch of feeling, “you are like your mother!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I know it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“How? I thought—nay, nay, you cannot remember her!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, I do.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“How and where?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“The face, only the face, I remember that, nothing more!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It was a beautiful face, Zana.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I know it—very beautiful!”</p>

<p class='c014'>His forehead grew heavy and dark. A look of wild horror
came into his eyes that were dwelling upon me in apparent
wrath.</p>

<p class='c014'>Just then a gun was fired near us, and through the trees I
saw George Irving and Morton coming toward us.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Hush, no outcry,” whispered the man, drawing me back into
a thicket. “Come, or do you wish them to see you?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, no—heaven forbid!” I cried, shrinking under cover.</p>

<p class='c014'>The man smiled grimly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is well,” he said; “there is no contamination here—the
blood is true to itself yet—I will leave you now!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, no, not till you tell me of my mother,” I cried, wild with
the dread of losing this clue to my history.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Not here, it is impossible,” was his answer. “You have that
black pony yet?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And are no coward? not afraid of the dark?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>“After nightfall come to yonder old house.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What, Marston Court?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, I will be there!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And will you tell me all?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes!”</p>

<p class='c014'>He darted from me while speaking, and the next instant all
trace of him was lost.</p>

<p class='c014'>I must have remained a long time buried in the woods, but I
have no remembrance even of my own sensations. So much
was crowded on my brain that it seemed stolid to all subjects
but the one great wish to learn more. Up to the time I met
that strange being, who seemed so familiar and yet so frightful,
I had been overwhelmed with tender grief. My father, suffering,
perhaps dying—my father so lately found, filled every
thought. No doubt entered my mind that he was my father;
for months the conviction had gradually settled upon me; but
when I remembered the distrust which tortured him, a painful
wish to conquer it—to sweep it away, possessed me, not for my
own sake—never for a moment did I think of any advantage it
might prove to myself—but that he might be satisfied; that
the cruel check that made his tenderness for me a torture
might be removed.</p>

<p class='c014'>But now came other feelings, such as I had never known or
dreamed of before. I have repeated that man’s conversation
word for word, but its effect no power of mine can reveal.
Instead of that tender, holy thirst for knowledge that might
give my father peace, a fierce curiosity took possession of my
soul. I felt not like a child, but an avenger. I would know
myself that night; mysteries should henceforth cease to surround
me. The blackness would be swept from my brain, and by that
man—that man. Was he man or demon? Could anything
human, with so little effort, have filled my bosom with bitterness?
I was to meet him that night, meet him in secrecy and
darkness, in a strange place—I, a young girl, not more than
seventeen. It did not frighten me; I panted for the hour to
come, though the very thought thrilled me through and through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>with the idea of a sacrilege performed with a demon. My heart
would now and then recoil from the thought, not in fear, but as
from something unholy that I had resolved to do.</p>

<p class='c014'>This thought could not deter me; on the contrary, it imparted
ferocious strength to my resolution. I was determined
to pluck and eat the fruit of knowledge, though it poisoned me.
Toward evening, when I saw the first beams of sunset shooting
like golden lances through the chestnut boughs and broken
against their stately boles, I awoke from this chaos of thought
and went home.</p>

<p class='c014'>As I mounted the stairs to my room, Maria called after me,
begging that I would come down and eat something; but I
hurried on, closed the door of my chamber, and bolted it without
answering a word. The very idea of seeing any one that
night was hateful. She came softly up the stairs and knocked
a long time, telling me that Turner had not been at home all
day, and that she was <em>so</em> anxious about us both. I took no
heed, but sat down by a window, looking with fierce impatience
on the west.</p>

<p class='c014'>A great embankment of clouds, black as chaos, rolled up
from where the sun had been, sweeping all its glowing gold and
crimson up through their ebon outskirts, where it burned and
quivered in folds and fringes of fiery brightness. It was a beautiful
sight, but lurid and wild, covering the earth with uncouth
shadows, and filling the woods with a pale glare that to me
seemed demoniac.</p>

<p class='c014'>It answered well to the fierce impatience gnawing at my
heart! Tented by that dark cloud, I should go forth on my
errand with firmness. The more dreary my road became, the
better I should like it.</p>

<p class='c014'>When the cloud had spread and blackened over the whole
horizon, I started up and put on my dress of dark cloth and a
broad-leaved beaver hat, which I tied firmly on my head with a
scarlet silk handkerchief, passed over the crown. I searched
for no gloves, but went out, darting like a shadow through the
hall, that Maria might not detect me.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>I stopped by a laburnum tree and broke off a shoot, stripping
the leaves away with my hand, for I had no time to search for
my little gold and agate-headed whip then. Jupiter was in his
stall. I girded on his saddle, and buckled the throat-latch of
his bridle so tightly, that he rose back, shaking off my hold.
At another time I might have regretted this impetuous haste,
but now I gave Jupiter a blow over the head with my whip,
that made him whimper like a child.</p>

<p class='c014'>I took no notice, but led him out, and from the door sill,
which was somewhat lifted from the ground, sprang to the
saddle. He hung back when I attempted to move, but I struck
him smartly over the ears and he walked on, but sideling and
plunging with great discontent. I suppose the dense clouds and
the close atmosphere terrified him; but to me their sluggish
grandeur was full of excitement.</p>

<p class='c014'>After we had cleared the woods, my old pony became more
tractable. Very soon his speed answered to my sharp impatience,
and we dashed on through the lurid twilight with spectre-like
velocity. As we neared Marston Court, the darkness
settled thick and heavy over everything. We could hardly distinguish
the turrets and pointed towers from the black sky that
they seemed to loom against. The road became ascending and
broken. More than once Jupiter stumbled over the loose
boulders that had rolled down the banks into the road.</p>

<p class='c014'>As we drew near the building the trees closed in upon us.
Their gnarled branches hung low, and vines now and then
trailed down, almost sweeping me from the saddle. The atmosphere
was heavy and still as death; not a leaf stirred; no
sound but the tramp of Jupiter reached us from any quarter.
My heart grew heavy. I would have given the world for a
gush of air or a gleam of starlight, everything around was so
terribly black.</p>

<p class='c014'>Still, I urged Jupiter on, following the deviations of a carriage-road
half choked up. We passed by a pile of something
that seemed denser and closer than the great trees, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>slowly assumed the outline of a building overrun with foliage,
and this I took for a ruined lodge.</p>

<p class='c014'>After passing it, we found ourselves tangled up in the luxurious
growth of some pleasure-ground run to waste; for long
trailing branches swept across my face, and from the perfume,
which rose heavy and sickening on the close air, I knew that Jupiter
was treading flowers to death every moment with his hoofs.</p>

<p class='c014'>At last, we came close to the building. All around the base
was matted and overrun with ivy, and the straggling branches
of ornamental trees. I checked Jupiter, hoping to detect some
light or signal to guide me on.</p>

<p class='c014'>The outline of a vast building alone met my search. It might
have been a heap of rocks or the spur of a mountain, for any
idea that I could obtain of its architecture; but its blackness
and size disheartened me. How was I to search, in a pile like
that, for the man I had come to meet? As I sat upon Jupiter
looking wistfully upward, the clouds broke above and began to
quiver, and from the depths rushed out a flash, followed by a
broad, lurid sheet of lightning.</p>

<p class='c014'>There, for the first time, and a single moment, I saw Marston
Court, its gables, its stone balconies, heavy with sculpture,
its facade flanked with towers that loomed grimly over the
broad steps and massive granite balustrades that wound up
from where we stood to the front door.</p>

<p class='c014'>In my whole life I never witnessed a scene more imposing.
A glimpse, and all was black again. The flash had given me
one view of the mansion, nothing more. I was impressed
painfully by its vastness. How could I force an entrance?—how
make way through the vast interior when that was obtained?</p>

<p class='c014'>It seemed a hopeless effort, but my determination was strong
as ever; so springing to the ground, I felt my way to the
stone balustrade and tied Jupiter. Then guiding myself by the
carved stone, I mounted one flight of the steps that curved like
the two horns of a crescent from the great oaken doors that
divided them upon the arch.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>I started, and a shriek burst from me. Upon my hand,
which lay upon the balustrade, another fell. When I shrieked
it grasped my fingers like iron, and a voice that I knew, said
in that language—the language I had never spoken, but could
understand—“hush. Who taught you to fear?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You came upon me so abruptly, so still!” I whispered,
shuddering as his breath floated across my lips.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Speak in your own language—speak Rommany,” he said,
in the same tongue.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I cannot,” was my half timid answer.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Try!”</p>

<p class='c014'>The command was imperative. I made an effort to answer
in his own mysterious tongue. To my surprise the words syllabled
themselves rudely on my trembling lips; he comprehended
me.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Where are you taking me?” I had said.</p>

<p class='c014'>He grasped my hand till the pain made me cry out.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is there—the true fire—old Papita kindled it in the
soul of her great-grandchild—the mystery is not broken—the
sorcery still works—queen of our people, speak again,” he
cried, with an outburst of fiery enthusiasm, more impressive
from the hushed tones in which he spoke.</p>

<p class='c014'>I felt like one possessed. By what power did my tongue
form that language?—what was it? All at once, while he
waited for me to speak, I began to shiver and burst into tears.
He tossed my hand away with a gesture of contempt.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Bah! you are only a half-blood after all, the Caloe is
poisoned on your tongue.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I checked the tears that so offended him, and moved breathlessly
forward, relieved by the gesture which had freed me
from his hand.</p>

<p class='c014'>When we reached the broad, stone platform that clasped the
two staircases in one, he took hold of my hand again. That
moment another flash of lightning leaped from the clouds,
sheeting us, the building and all its neglected grounds in a
glare of bluish light.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>It blinded me for an instant, then I saw the man’s face
clearly, bending over me as I cowered to the stones. The
lightning had no effect upon me like the unearthly glow of
those eyes. Since then I have seen birds fascinated by the
undulating movements of a serpent, and they always brought
back a shuddering remembrance of that hour.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Up,” he said, grasping my arm, and lifting me to his side,
“half the true blood is stagnant still. We will set it on fire.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He placed one heavy foot against a leaf of the oaken door,
and it fell open with a clang that resounded frightfully from
the deep, empty hall. Again the lightning blazed upon the
floor, tessellated with blocks of black and white marble, and
suits of antique armor, with shields and firearms, that hung
upon the wall.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is a fearful night,” I said, looking wildly at my companion.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Gitanilla!” he said, turning upon me with folded arms, and
a fierce gathering of the brow, “I have seen a morning when
the sunlight lay rosy among the snow peaks—when the earth
seemed covered with sifted pearls—when every breath poured
health and vigor into the frame; I have seen such a morning
more fearful a thousand times than this! Come with me!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What for?—where?” I demanded, thrilled and astonished
by the glowing words, which I must ever fail to give in
English.</p>

<p class='c014'>“That you may hate the sunshine and love the storm as I
do—that whiteness may make you shudder—and nothing but
black midnight seem beautiful. Come with me!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Are you possessed? Would you possess me with some
evil thing?” I said, terribly excited. “Would you fill my
veins with gall, my soul with hate?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes,” he answered, through his shut teeth, leading me
along the marble floor.</p>

<p class='c014'>I shuddered, remembering what I had been only that morning,
and the fearful sensations that possessed me then. Was it
a fiend that I was following?</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>“Oh, I feel the bitterness, the soul-blight even now. Unclasp
my hand,” I shrieked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Are you afraid?” he retorted, with a sneer.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, I am afraid.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He dropped my hand.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Go, you are not worthy to learn anything of your mother—go,
such knowledge is not for cowards.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“My mother,” I cried, “oh, I had forgotten. Yes, tell me
of her—I will follow anywhere, only tell me.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Nay, I will tell you everything—come!”</p>

<p class='c014'>He drew me rapidly forward, threading the darkness like a
night bird. We mounted steps winding upward till I was sick
and dizzy. At last he passed into what seemed to me a small
circular room, high in one of the towers.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Sit down,” he said, pressing a hand upon my shoulder till I
sunk into a seat that yielded to my weight. “Sit down and
keep still, we are alone, high above the earth; the stars, which
those of your blood should read like a parchment, are all hidden.
It has a bad look for the future, but this is the appointed
hour.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He paused a moment, and seemed to be leaning from a narrow
window interrogating the darkness. He turned abruptly
and said,</p>

<p class='c014'>“You saw Lord Clare, this morning?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And he is dying?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Alas! I fear so.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“How many days first?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What!” I exclaimed, shocked by the coldness with which
he questioned me.</p>

<p class='c014'>“How many days at the most will he live?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I cannot tell; God forbid that I should even guess.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Would you save his life?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Would I?—would I keep the breath in my own bosom?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then you wish him to live?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Wish it, yes—heaven only knows how much!”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>“Renegade!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Nay,” he said, with a sudden change from ferocity to the
most child-like tenderness, “let her know all—how can she
judge?”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XLII.<br> <span class='large'>VISIONS AND RETROSPECTIONS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Chaleco came close to me and laid one hand softly on my
head.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Be tranquil—be tranquil,” he murmured, smoothing my
hair from time to time.</p>

<p class='c014'>A soft languor stole over me. I sunk slowly down upon
what seemed to be a couch, and like two rose-leaves heavy with
fragrance, my eyelids closed so softly that I felt a thrill as the
lashes fell upon my cheek.</p>

<p class='c014'>He kept one hand upon my head awhile, then moved it
gently across my forehead and over my eyes. I felt a delicious
and almost imperceptible current of air flowing coolly over my
bosom and down my arms. Then the air was agitated, as if a
group of angels were fanning me with their wings; the lids fell
heavier still over my slumberous eyes; my limbs grew rigid,
but with a sensation of exquisite repose. It began to lighten.
I knew that fiery gleams were breaking and sparkling all
around me. Then followed peal after peal of thunder making
the tower rock, and upheaving, as it seemed, the very foundations
of the building.</p>

<p class='c014'>I was conscious of all this, but it did not disturb the languid
repose into which I had fallen. The dawning consciousness of
two lives—two entire beings came sweetly upon my soul. I
saw my old self fading away; I was alone in the universe with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>that man; the whole past or present, for the time, held nothing
but him and me. Then followed a blank like that which
fills the first year of infancy, dreamy and quiet.</p>

<p class='c014'>Pang after pang went through me after that, each sweeping
the shadows from my brain; and I saw a young girl, mature
in her dark bright beauty, but almost a child still, holding an
infant in her lap. The little one was like its mother, the same
eyes, the same rich complexion. I knew the mother well, and
the child. My own soul, full of innocent love, lay in the
bosom of that child.</p>

<p class='c014'>I looked around. The two were in an old farm-house, among
hills covered with purple heath; sheep grazed along the upland
slopes; and cattle ranged the valleys. Men in short, plaid
garments and flat bonnets watched the sheep; and the young
mother carried her child to the window, that it might see the
lambs play as the shepherds drove them to the fold.</p>

<p class='c014'>While the mother stood there with her child, a stout farmer
came to the window, and taking the little one from her arms
began to dance it up and down in the bright air, till the silken
curls blew all over its face. The mother laughed, and so did
the child, gleefully, like a little bird. Then came a woman
round an angle of the house; her sleeves were rolled up, leaving
her round, well-shaped arms bare to the elbow. She took
the child from her good man, and smoothing its curls with her
plump fingers, covered it with kisses.</p>

<p class='c014'>A shot from the hill-side made the whole group start joyfully
forward. The old man shaded his eyes and looked eagerly toward
the mountain. The young mother seized her child and
ran forward, her eyes sparkling, and her cheeks in a glow.</p>

<p class='c014'>Along the shore of a little lake that lay in the lap of those
hills, came a young man in hunter’s dress. A gun, which he
had just discharged, was thrown back upon his shoulders, and
as he saw the young mother coming toward him, he flung out a
white handkerchief, smiling a happy welcome.</p>

<p class='c014'>I knew the young man’s face well, and my soul, which was in
the child’s bosom, sang for joy as he came up.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>A moment of obscurity, of mistiness and shadows—then appeared
before me the cottage in Greenhurst, its gardens, its dim
old wilderness of trees; and now my soul leaped from event to
event, scaling over all that might have been repose, and seizing
upon the rugged points of that human history like a vampire.</p>

<p class='c014'>Again and again I saw that young mother, so beautiful, so
sad, that every fibre of my being ached with sympathy. It
was not her face or her form alone that I saw, but all the doubt,
the anguish, the humiliation of her wild, proud nature tortured
my own being. I not only saw her, but felt all the changes of
her soul writing themselves on my own intelligence.</p>

<p class='c014'>Why was it that in that wonderful sleep or trance—I know
not to this day what it was—but how did it happen that I
could read every thought and feeling in my mother’s heart, but
only the actions of my father? Did that weird being so will
it, that all my burning nature should pour itself forth in sympathy
for the wronged woman, and harden into iron toward the
man? I saw him too, pale, struggling with indecisions, that
ended in more than mental torture, but this awoke no sympathy
in my bosom, none, none. Then came another upon my vision,
a proud, noble woman, always clad in black, that hovered
around the old dwelling where my father rested, like a raven.
She was my mother’s rival; I felt it the moment her black
shadow fell upon my memory. I saw her in a dim old room,
and he was with her. Both were pale and in trouble; she sat
watching him through her tears, and those tears shook his manhood
till he trembled from head to foot. A child, dark-eyed,
and with a look of intelligence beyond her years, sat crouching
in a corner, with her great black eyes following every movement—I
knew that child well. It was the infant who had
shouted its joyous greeting to the young huntsman. Its blood
was beating then in my own veins.</p>

<p class='c014'>Again I saw the woman, beneath a clump of gnarled old oaks.
She lay prone upon the earth, white as death, stiffened like a
corpse; a horse dripping with sweat stood cowering on the
other side of a chasm that yawned between him and the lady.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>There was that child again, peering out from a thicket, with her
wild eyes gleaming with ferocious joy, as if she gloried in the
stillness that lay like death upon the woman.</p>

<p class='c014'>Then a huntsman rode up, and I saw the white face of the
woman on his bosom. He kissed the face—he wept over it—he
laid her on the grass, and looked piteously around for
help.</p>

<p class='c014'>Then the child sprang up like a tiger-cub from the thicket;
with a bound she stood beside the two; her little form dilating,
her whole attitude full of wrath. Words were spoken, between
the man and the child, bitter, harsh words. Then the woman
moved faintly; the child saw it; her tiny hands were clenched;
her teeth locked together, and lifting her foot, she struck it
fiercely down upon the lady’s bosom.</p>

<p class='c014'>A blow from the man dashed her to the ground; confusion
followed, flashes as of fire filled my vision. Then I saw the child
wandering through the tall trees alone, her little features
locked, her arms tightly folded.</p>

<p class='c014'>It grew dark, so dark that under the trees the young mother,
who stood by her child, could not see the fierce paleness of her
face. Then I saw them both wandering like thieves along the
vast mansion house. They were separated. The mother went
into numberless chambers searching for some one, and holding
her breath. At one moment she stood over a bed, on which
the strange woman slept; then I was sure that the child was
hers by the deadly blackness of her eyes as they fell on the
noble sleeper. She passed out with one hand firmly clenched,
though it held nothing, and wandered into the darkness again.</p>

<p class='c014'>Once more she stood in the light, dim and faint, for the lamp
that gave it was hidden under an alabaster shade, and sent
forth only a few pale rays like moonbeams. I saw little that
surrounded her, for my soul was searching the great agony of
heart with which she stood beside that man. He was not in
bed, but wrapped in a dressing-gown of some rich Oriental
silk, lay upon a couch with his eyes closed and smiling.</p>

<p class='c014'>She held her breath, and the last tender love that ever beat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>in her heart swelled up from its depths as she bent down and
gathered the smile with her lips.</p>

<p class='c014'>He started. She fell upon her knees; she locked his hand in
hers; her black tresses drooped over him; oh, with what agony
pleaded for a return of the love that had been the pulse of her
life, the breath on her lips.</p>

<p class='c014'>He arose and shook her off—with a mighty effort he steeled
his heart and shook her off, the mother of his child, the wife of
his bosom. She stood upright, pale and transfigured. For one
whole minute she remained gazing on him speechless, and so
still that the beating of his heart sounded clear and distinct in
the room. She turned and glided into the darkness again, and
she disappeared with her child, who waited for her there.</p>

<p class='c014'>Then followed a panorama of scenery, rivers, mountains, and
seas, over which the mother wandered, holding her child by the
hand. At last she stood in sight of an ancient city, rich with
Moorish relics, but as I turned to gaze on them a crowd of
fierce human beings surrounded her, filling the air with hoarse
noises, glaring at her and the child with their fierce eyes. An
old woman, tiny as a child, and thin as a mummy, stood by,
shouting back their reviling with defiance. Thus with whoop,
and taunt, and sacrilegious gibes, they drove the poor creature
onward to the mountains. Up and up she clambered with the
little one still clinging to her neck, till the snow became heavy
around her, and she waded knee deep through it, tottering and
faint. At last the crowd surged together around a mountain
peak, and pointed with hoarse shouts to a valley half choked
up with stone cairns and shimmering with untrod snow.</p>

<p class='c014'>Down into the virgin whiteness of this valley the black
masses poured, treading down the snow with all their squalid
ferocity doubled by contrast with its whiteness. They took
the child from her mother and carried her shrieking to the outskirts
of the crowd. I knew the man that held her, and read
all the fierce agony of his grief as he strove to blind the child
to the horrible deed that crowd was perpetrating.</p>

<p class='c014'>I saw it all—the first unsteady whirl of stones, the fiendish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>eagerness that followed; I heard the shrieks—I felt her death
agony.</p>

<p class='c014'>Oh, how I struggled! how I pleaded with the strong will
that enslaved my faculties! how I prayed that he would redeem
me from the horrors of that mountain pass! But no, the curse
of memory must be complete; I was compelled to live over the
agony of my mother’s death.</p>

<p class='c014'>I knew well all the time that the child and myself were one
being; but as in ordinary life a person often looks upon his
own sufferings with self-pity, as if he were a stranger; so I followed
wearily after the little creature as they bore her, an
orphan, from the Valley of Stones. I saw her growing thin,
pining, pining always for the mother who was dead, till she
grew into a miserable shadow, with all the life of her being
burning in those large eyes. The old woman and the man kept
her to themselves, but she seemed pining to death while they
wandered from mountain to mountain, and at last across the
seas.</p>

<p class='c014'>Again Greenhurst arose on my vision, the old building among
distant trees, the village just in sight. A gipsy’s tent stood in
a hollow, back from the wayside, and in it lay the shadowy
child.</p>

<p class='c014'>The gipsy man and that weird little woman were in the tent,
and from without I heard the ringing of bells and the tramp of
horses, smothered and soft, as if each hoof-fall were broken
with flowers.</p>

<p class='c014'>Then I forgot the sick child and stood within the village
church. <em>He</em> was there standing before the altar, his hand
clasped that of the proud lady who had so often wandered
through the drama which I was forced to witness. The bridegroom
was pale as death, and she looked strangely pallid in the
silvery cloud of her brocaded robe. Still she was firm, and I
saw that nothing had been confided to her—that the history
of my poor mother had never reached the bosom of that
proud woman. <em>He</em> was resolute, resolute to trample down
every right of another in search of his own happiness. Fool!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>fool! happiness will not be thus wickedly wrenched from the
hands of the Creator. Even then, before God’s altar, he had
begun to reap the whirlwind. Coming events cast their shadows
all around. No wonder he grew white. No wonder the
marriage vows died like snow upon his lips. No wonder that
all the bridal blossoms with which the greensward glowed when
they went in, had withered beneath the hot sun! Their dying
fragrance fell over the noble pair as they came forth wedded
man and wife. Man and wife! had he forgotten the subterranean
vaults beneath the Alhambra, where my mother stood by
his side with firmer faith and more devoted constancy than that
woman ever knew? Was that oath forgotten? No, as he
came forth into the sunshine treading down the pale blossoms
as he had trampled my mother out of life, a bronzed hand, long
and lean as a vulture’s claw, was thrust over his path; and
night-shade fell thick among the dead blossoms. He did not
see it, for the weird gipsy woman moved like a shadow among
the village children; but he shrunk as if with some hidden
pain, and grew paler than before.</p>

<p class='c014'>The will that controlled mine forced me onward with the
newly married pair. I saw him struggle against the leaden
memories that would not be swept away. His mournful smile,
as he looked on her, was full of saddened love. I could have
pitied them but for my mother. I saw what they did not, her
grave, that cairn of reddened stones looming before them at
every step. They shuddered beneath the invisible shadow, but
I knew from whence it fell.</p>

<p class='c014'>Their route to Greenhurst was trampled over a carpet of
flowers; silver and gold fell like rain among the village children;
the carriage streaming with favors swept by that gipsy
tent where the sick child was lying, his child, all unconscious of
its double orphanage.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the thralldom of my intellect I was forced to look on,
though my strength was giving way. With shrinking terror I
watched the movements of that weird murderess as she crept
into Greenhurst, and with the accuracy of a bloodhound stole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>through the very apartments my mother had penetrated, crawling
like a reptile close to the walls, till she stood upright in the
bridal chamber. She concealed herself behind the snowy masses
of drapery that fell around the bed.</p>

<p class='c014'>While her form was shrouded in the heavy waves of silk, her
dark face peered, ever and anon, through the transparent lace
of the inner curtains like that of a watching fiend.</p>

<p class='c014'>As one whose senses were locked in a single channel, I too
waited and watched. People came in and out of the room,
little dreaming of the fiend hidden in the snow of the curtains.</p>

<p class='c014'>Even in its slavery my spirit sickened as I watched and saw
the withered veins of that unearthly wretch swelling with murderous
venom, while her victims were moving unconsciously in
the next room.</p>

<p class='c014'>The curtains rustled, that claw-like hand was thrust out, and
I saw half a dozen drops flash down like diamonds into a goblet
of water that had just been placed on the toilet.</p>

<p class='c014'>Then a door opened, and the bride entered from her dressing-room
alone. In the simple white of her robe she looked
touching and lovely, like one subdued and humbled by the
depth of her own feelings. The delicate lace of her night coif
left a shadow on her temples less deep than that which lay
beneath her eyes. Her bosom rose slowly and with suppressed
respiration beneath the rich embroidery that embossed her
night robe, and her uncovered feet fell almost timidly on the
carpet; not with girlish bashfulness, but with a sort of religious
awe as one visits a place of prayer afraid to enter.</p>

<p class='c014'>She knelt down by the bed, and clasping her hands, remained
still, as if some prayer lay at the bottom of her heart, which
she had not the courage to breathe aloud. The broad, white
eyelids were closed, and twice I saw that fiendish face glaring
at her through the curtains.</p>

<p class='c014'>She arose at length, and heaving a deep sigh, stepped into
bed. As she sunk to the pillow her eye fell upon the goblet,
and resting on one elbow, she reached forth her hand and drank
off its contents.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>As she fell softly back to the pillows, a hoarse chuckle came
through the curtains. She started, turned her face that way,
and out came that black head, peering at her with its terrible
eyes. A broken sigh, a shudder that made the white drapery
rustle as if in a current of wind, and the bride lay with her eyes
wide open staring upon the Sibyl.</p>

<p class='c014'>The dead face grew more and more pallid; the dark one
above glowed and gloated over it like a ghoul. Then the soft
light was darkened, and the bridegroom leaned over his bride
listening for her breath. As he stooped, the curtains opposite
were flung back, the lace torn away, and like an exulting
demon the old woman laughed over the living and the dead.</p>

<p class='c014'>The scene changed, the old woman, the gipsy man and the
child were in a tent at midnight. The poor little one, aroused
from her torpid rest, looked wildly up as the Sibyl told of her
murderous act—told of it and perished in the midst of her
triumph—her old age, exhausted by the excitement of her crime,
ended in death.</p>

<p class='c014'>As the life left her body, I felt a shock run through my
whole being; the past was linked with the present. Back to
that gipsy tent my memory ran strong and connectedly.</p>

<p class='c014'>I struggled in the mesmeric hands which guided my energies
like steel.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Peace,” said the man who had enthralled me, “peace, and
remember.”</p>

<p class='c014'>There was a stir in the air as if some unseen bird were fanning
it with his wings, a cool and delicious feeling of rest crept
over me, and as a child wakes I opened my eyes. The Spanish
gipsy stood over me revealed by the quick flashes of lightning
that blazed through the room. I knew that he had been my
mother’s friend, that the blood in his veins was of her nation
and mine. I reached forth my hand. He took it in his, and I
sat up.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You remember all now?” he said—“all that I have revealed
to you—all that old Papita bade you forget?”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>“Yes, I remember—I know much, but not all; that which
happened before I lived, tell me of that.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Not yet, you are tired!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, but”——</p>

<p class='c014'>A faintness came over me, my strength had received too
great a shock; for a time I had no power to think or feel.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XLIII.<br> <span class='large'>THE DESOLATE BRIDAL CHAMBERS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>After a while, during which I had been stupefied with the
very weight of my new existence, the man came close to me
and took my hand.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Child,” he said, bending over me till I could see the glitter
of his eyes. “Child, are your eyes open? Is the knowledge
complete?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Complete!” I answered, with a shudder.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Look at me—who am I? What part have I taken in the
past?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You are Chaleco—you loved my mother who fled with <em>him</em>.
You bore me from the snow mountains, and warmed me in your
arms when thoughts of her chilled me to the soul.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And is that all?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, the tent. I saw you there when that fierce woman
fell dead upon the earth!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is complete,” he said, drawing himself up and lifting one
hand to heaven, while the lightning glared upon him, “the
Egyptian mysteries have lost nothing of their power,—that
which was eternal in Papita lives still in Chaleco. Who shall
prevail against one who holds a being like this in his grasp?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>The soul which she put to sleep I awake. Girl of the Caloe,
stand up, let me see if the blood of our people is strong in your
veins.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I stood upright, planting my feet upon the floor firm as a
rock. His words seemed to inspire me with wild vitality. As
I looked him in the face quick gleams of lightning shot around
us; my soul grew fierce and strong beneath the lurid flashes
of his eyes; my own scintillated as with sparks of fire. He
spoke.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Speak—are you Caloe, or of the gentile? Base or brave?
Speak the thought that is burning within you. Are you Aurora’s
child or his?”</p>

<p class='c014'>My form dilated, my bosom heaved, I felt the hot blood
flashing up to my forehead.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am Zana, Aurora’s child,” I answered, with ineffable
haughtiness. “The snow that drank her blood quenched the
pale drops in my veins.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Come,” cried Chaleco, seizing my hand—“come and see
the desolation which her rival left behind. You saw the wedding—your
father’s wedding—come, now, and look at the home
that was to receive the bride.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He went to a fire-place that yawned in the chamber, and fell
upon his knees. Directly I heard the clash as of flint and steel
driven furiously against each other, and the empty fire-place
was revealed by the storm of sparks that broke upon the sculptured
stones. His wild impetuosity defeated itself; five or six
times he crashed the metal in one hand against the flint which
was clenched in the other. At last the fierce sparks centred in a
volume, and with a flaming torch in one hand Chaleco stood up.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You are pale,” he said, gazing sternly upon me. “Is this
fear?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No,” I answered, subduing a thrill of awe, as the darkness
which had so long enveloped me was driven back in shadows,
that hung like funereal drapery in the angles and corners of the
chamber—“no, I am not afraid. But that which has been
revealed to me may well leave my face white.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>He looked at me keenly, holding up the torch till its blaze
flamed across my eyes. This scrutiny of my features seemed to
satisfy him, for his lip curved till the white teeth gleamed
through, and he muttered to himself, “It is right—the blood
that has left her face burns in the heart—she is one of us.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Muttering thus, he led the way from the chamber, sending a
lurid glare backward from his torch along the damp walls of
the circular staircase. Thus breaking through the shadows
that gathered thick and close in the old building, he led me on.
The tread of his heavy boots resounded through the vast apartments
with a defiant clamor. He took no precaution to conceal
his torch, which glared back from the closed windows as if
the dull glass had been on fire.</p>

<p class='c014'>We threaded galleries hung with grim old pictures, and peopled
with statues, some antiques, some of bronze, and others
simply of armor, the iron shells from which warriors had
perished. A thrill of awe crept over me as I passed these
stern counterfeits of humanity, with their grim hollows choked
up with shadows. As the torchlight fell now upon the limb of
a statue, now across the fierce visage of a picture, now upon
the dull carvings of oak, my imagination increased the desolate
grandeur, till marble, iron, and canvas seemed instinct with
vitality.</p>

<p class='c014'>This effect was not diminished by the wild look which Chaleco
sent back from time to time, as I followed him.</p>

<p class='c014'>At last we reached a door, inlaid and empanelled with precious
woods. Chaleco attempted to turn the lock. It resisted,
and after shaking it fiercely, he dashed one foot against it,
which forced the bolt that had rusted in its socket.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Come in,” he said, “you shall see how the widow had
prepared for her young bridegroom.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I entered, but the dull atmosphere, the damp, mouldly smell
was like that of a tomb. Chaleco held up his torch, throwing
its strong light in glaring flashes through the darkness. It had
been a superb suit of apartments, hangings of azure silk, stained
and black with mildew; Parisian carpets, from which clouds of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>dust rose at every foot-tread; gildings that time had blackened
into bronze, filled my gaze with a picture of silent desolation,
that made my already worn heart sink heavier and heavier in
my bosom.</p>

<p class='c014'>I shrank back. Chaleco saw it, and urged me on with a
grim smile. I remembered the scene of death he had revealed
to me in my unnatural sleep, and feared to look upon the place
of its actual perpetration.</p>

<p class='c014'>The chamber we entered had once been all white and superb
in its adornments. The walls were yet hung with fluted satin,
once rich in snowy gloss but now striped with black, for
accumulations of dust had filled all the flutings. Masses of
dusky lace flowed down the windows, and were entangled over
the bed with many a dim cobweb, that the spiders had been
years weaving among their delicate meshes. Dust and mildew
had crept over the bridal whiteness of everything. The couch
seemed heaped with shadows; cobwebs hung low from the
gilded cornices that gleamed through them here and there with
ghastly splendor.</p>

<p class='c014'>As Chaleco lifted his torch above the couch, a bat rent its
way through the lace, scattering a cloud of dust over us, and
remained overhead drearily flapping his impish wings among the
cobwebs, till they swayed over us like a thunder-cloud.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Was it here the old woman killed her?” I whispered.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, she never reached this. It was at Greenhurst.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why do you bring me here?” I said, shuddering.</p>

<p class='c014'>“That you may see how much power there was in an old
woman’s curse.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is terrible,” I whispered, looking around. “My mother,
has she not been fearfully avenged?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Avenged!” answered the gipsy; “do you call this vengeance?
Not till every member of that proud house is in the
dust—not till Aurora’s child triumphs over them, body and
soul, shall Papita’s curse be fulfilled!”</p>

<p class='c014'>His words fell upon me like blows; they were crushing me
to the earth. I thought of George Irving. His treachery
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>was forgotten; my heart only remembered his kindness—his
love.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What, all?” I questioned.</p>

<p class='c014'>“All! Poverty, disgrace, death, these are the curses which
Papita has left for you to accomplish.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“For me?” I questioned, aghast.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You—yes, it is your inheritance. She left it—I enforce—you
accomplish it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>As he spoke, the bat made a faint noise that struck upon my
ear like the amen of a demon, and, sweeping down from his
cloud of cobwebs, he made a dash at Chaleco’s torch which was
extinguished by his wings.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Give me your hand!” The gipsy seized my arm as he
spoke, and led me onward in the darkness. I followed in
silence, rendered desperate by all I had suffered and seen.</p>

<p class='c014'>At length we reached the open air, and stood together upon
the entrance steps. The rain had ceased, the clouds were
drifting together in broken masses, leaving fissures and gleams
where the cold blue was visible, winding like half frozen rivers
between the dull clouds. The dense vegetation, the vines and
huge elms were dripping with rain, and every leaf shone like
silver when the moon, for a moment, struggled out from the
clouds that overwhelmed it.</p>

<p class='c014'>My horse stood cowering by the steps. The whole force of
the storm had beat cruelly upon the poor old fellow.</p>

<p class='c014'>Chaleco lifted me to his back, and commanding me to wait,
went away. Directly he came back, mounted on what appeared
to be a spirited horse, which he rode without saddle.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Come on!” he said, striking Jupiter with his whip, “let’s
be moving.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Where?” I questioned, sick at heart with a fear that he
would not allow me to return home.</p>

<p class='c014'>“To your inheritance—to Greenhurst.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But that is not my inheritance!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You are the child of its lord, and he is dying.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But I am not his heiress.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>“Before morning you will have proof that you are his child.
You know surely how to work on the repentance of a dying
man. Go to him, Zana; this estate and others are his—no
claim, no drawback—nothing that the English call an entail on
it. One dash of his hand, and it is yours.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But it was hers, not his—Marston Court belonged to Lord
Clare’s wife,” I said, recoiling from the idea of possessing wealth
that had once belonged to my mother’s rival.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It must be wrested from the Clares—it must be an inheritance
for you and your people, Zana,” he said, riding close to me,
as Jupiter picked his way along the broken road, which was left
almost impassable by the storm. And he added,</p>

<p class='c014'>“If that man dies without enriching you and your tribe
by the spoils of his marriage, the curse of Papita will fall on
you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is here already,” I answered, shuddering; “with nothing
to trust—nothing to love—deceived, cheated, outraged. What
curse can equal this?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Have you not deserved it?” he questioned, sternly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“How?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Where was your heart? Had not the blood of our people
grown pale in it? Did you give it to a Clare, and hope to go
uncursed? The cry of your mother’s blood, is it nothing?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I did not know it—oh, would to heaven I had never
known,” was my wild answer. “What am I to do?—how
act?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Go home—be passive—let the curse work itself out. You
know all—tell it to your father.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It will murder him!” I cried.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well!”</p>

<p class='c014'>The word fell upon my ear like a blow, it was uttered so
fiercely.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, don’t!—this conflict—this hardness—it kills me.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, there must be death, but not for you, till the work is
done.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, what is this fearful work?”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>“Nothing, only wait. Men who know how to wait for vengeance
need only be patient and look on. Death is here—I
this night give you proofs that will sweep all the wealth Lord
Clare controls into his daughter’s lap. Poh! child, revenge is
nothing when forced, the soul that knows how to wait need not
work.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I did not comprehend the cold-blooded philosophy of his
words—what young heart could? But one thing I did understand;
George Irving might be independent of his mother. The
property that Chaleco was grasping for me must be wrested
from him. A fierce joy possessed me with the thought. If this
wealth were offered to me it would place his destiny in my
hands. I could withhold or restore independence to the man
who had trifled with my orphanage—stolen the friend from my
bosom, and uprooted my faith in human goodness. Not for one
moment did I dream of taking his inheritance, but there was
joy in the thought of humbling him to the dust, by restoring it
with my own hands. Too young to comprehend the refined
selfishness of this idea, it really seemed that there was magnanimity
in this desire to humiliate a man I had loved.</p>

<p class='c014'>As we rode on toward Greenhurst, my frame began to sink
beneath the excitement that nothing human could have supported.
My head reeled; the damp branches that swept across
my path almost tore me from the saddle. Jupiter too was
tired and worn out with the drenching storm. He staggered
along the road with his head bent to the ground, ready to
drop beneath my insignificant weight. Chaleco saw this, and
rode closer to my side just in time to receive me on his arm as
I was falling.</p>

<p class='c014'>Without a word he lifted me to his own horse, and cast
Jupiter’s bridle loose.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Poor old fellow, let him go home,” he said with a laugh;
“but as for you and I, Zana, we have more to accomplish
yet.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He held me close with his left arm, grasping the bridle with
the same hand. With his right palm upon my forehead, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>rode slowly for a while, till the strength came back to my
limbs, and a certain vividness of intelligence possessed me
again. Then he spoke.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Hold tight to me, and be strong. We have lost much
time that may be important.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Without waiting for a reply, he put his horse into a sharp
canter and sped on, I hardly knew or cared in what direction.
At last, he dismounted and placed me upon the ground, asking
abruptly if I knew the objects around me. The moon was out
just then, and I looked earnestly about. It was the spot where
the gipsy tent had been pitched. The spring where I had
found Cora, when an infant, flowed softly on in the hollow at
a little distance, and before me, where the moonbeams lay
like silver upon the wet grass, I saw the meadow which had
once been my sole place of refuge.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You know the place?” said Chaleco; “it was here <em>she</em> died.
Wait a little.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He searched among the ferns that overhung the bank, which
I have described as rising abruptly from the spring, and drew
forth a pick-axe and spade covered with rust. A fragment
of rock lay imbedded in the bank around which mosses and
gorse of many years’ growth had crept.</p>

<p class='c014'>With two or three blows of the pick-axe, he sent this stone
crashing down into the water, which rose up in a wild shower
all around as it recoiled from the rude mass.</p>

<p class='c014'>Chaleco shook off the drops like a water-dog, and continued
to turn up the earth. Directly he lifted a slab of slate
rock, broad, and some inches thick, which certainly could not
originally have belonged to the soil in which it lay.</p>

<p class='c014'>Throwing this slab back, the gipsy fell upon his knees, and,
groping downward, brought up a bronze box or coffer, from
which he brushed the soil with reverential slowness.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Loose the key hung around your neck by that chain of
hair,” he said, holding the box up in the moonlight and searching
for the lock.</p>

<p class='c014'>I started. This was proof undoubted that the gipsy had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>never lost a clue to my identity, for no human being, except
Maria, was aware that a key of antique gold and platina had
always hung around my neck.</p>

<p class='c014'>I drew it forth with a feeling of awe, and watched in silence
while Chaleco fitted it in the lock. It turned with difficulty,
grating in the rust, and when the lid gave way, it was with
a noise that sounded upon my ear like a moan of suppressed
pain.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What is it?” I said, looking into the open box as one
gazes into a coffin after it has been long closed, curious, but
yet afraid.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is all that you will ever know of her—of your mother!”
he answered with a touch of bitter sadness in his voice.</p>

<p class='c014'>I received the box reverentially in both my hands.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Take it,” said Chaleco, closing the lid; “read them before
you sleep!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It seems to me that I should never sleep again.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I said this to Chaleco, but he answered me sharply, and
thrusting the spade and pick-axe aside with his foot, strode
away telling me to follow. The sight of the box I held seemed
to irritate him, as the scent of blood excites a wild animal. I
folded it to my bosom with both arms, and though it sent a
chill through every vein of my body, and made me stagger
beneath its weight, I tightened my hold each moment with a
painful feeling that I held the very soul of my mother close to
mine.</p>

<p class='c014'>Chaleco strode on in silence. The shadow from his broad
leafed hat deepened the sombre gloom of his countenance; the
moonlight which struck across the lower part of his face, revealed
the ferocious compression of his mouth.</p>

<p class='c014'>With all my fatigue, I scarcely felt the distance as we walked
rapidly through the park. Chaleco did not speak till we came
in sight of my home, then he paused and turned.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Zana,” he said, speaking low and huskily—“Zana, remember
you have a stern task for this night—your mother’s death
to revenge—your people’s interest to secure. Read and act.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>He spoke with an effort, and sprang away as if the presence
of any human thing were a torture.</p>

<p class='c014'>I was in the edge of our garden when he left me. A noise
among the shrubs drew me onward, and I found Jupiter lying
close to his stable, still saddled, and with the bridle dangling
around his head.</p>

<p class='c014'>I had no room in my heart for compassion, even for the poor
old fellow. To have saved his life, I would not have set down
my box for a moment; so I left him and entered the house.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XLIV.<br> <span class='large'>THE BRONZE COFFER AND MY MOTHER’S JOURNAL.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>A night lamp burned in the lower entrance, for Turner was
still absent, and Maria supposed us both at Greenhurst. I took
the lamp and went to my room.</p>

<p class='c014'>No sense of fatigue—not even the awe that crept over me,
could restrain the desire that I felt to examine the box. I
placed it on the floor, fell upon my knees, and, with the lamp
standing near, lifted the lid.</p>

<p class='c014'>A quantity of folded papers, and the gleam of antique gold,
floated mistily beneath my gaze. My fingers trembled as they
touched the papers, yellow with age, and blackened with the
written misery of my mother. I took them up, one by one,
reverently, and holding my breath. It was long before I could
see to distinguish one letter from another. But at last the
paper ceased to rattle in my hand—the delicate letters grew
distinct, and with eager eyes I devoured them.</p>

<p class='c014'>At first, the writing was broken in its language and stiff in
chirography, like the earnest attempts of a school-girl to write.
The sentiments too were imperfectly expressed, and full of wild
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>fancies that so appealed to my own nature that my heart
answered them like an echo.</p>

<p class='c014'>There was something child-like and exceedingly beautiful in
the expressions of happiness, which broke out through all the
imperfections of language and style. The poetry of a rich
nature, just beginning to yield itself to the influences of civilization,
spoke in every word. Never did the records of a human
life seem so full of sunshine—never have I seen a register of
affection so deep, and of a faith so perfect.</p>

<p class='c014'>I read eagerly, turning over page after page, and gathering
their contents at a glance. The dates changed frequently. At
first, they were in Seville, then in various continental cities,
where, it seems, Lord Clare had taken her after their flight from
Granada, upon whose snow mountains she had at last perished.</p>

<p class='c014'>Still, the record continued one of unbroken happiness. She
invariably mentioned Lord Clare as her husband; but now and
then came an expression of anxiety for the thoughtfulness that
would, at times, resist all her efforts to amuse him. As the
manuscript progressed, it was easy to trace the development of
a vigorous mind under the influence of an intellect more powerful
than itself. There was a break in the manuscript. The
next date was indefinite. No town, no county, but simply the
hills of Scotland.</p>

<p class='c014'>Oh, how beautiful was the gush of affection with which she
spoke of her infant! How thoroughly maternal joy expanded
and deepened every feeling of her womanhood! Still it was
here that I found the first trace of that sorrow which soon
darkened every page. Her warm heart was dissatisfied with
the measured affection with which Lord Clare received his
child. She questioned the cause, finding it only in herself—her
want of power to interest wholly a mind like his. She wrote of
two old people who were kind to her and her little one, while
Lord Clare was abroad on the hills, or absent on some of those
long journeys which he occasionally made into England.</p>

<p class='c014'>Again the scene changed, and she was at Greenhurst, so happy,
so more than pleased with the beauty and comforts of the home
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>which promised to be permanent at last. She described the
dwelling, the rooms, with their exquisite adornments, the statuettes
and pictures, with the glow of a vivid mind and warm
heart. She spoke of her child—the pretty room that was prepared
for it—the devotion of a woman whom Lord Clare had
procured from Spain. How fearfully strange it seemed that I
was the child so loved and cared for; that even then I was
acting my part in the mournful drama that had left me worse
than an orphan! How often did I find myself described, my
eyes, the flowing wealth of my curls, the precocious vigor of my
mind!</p>

<p class='c014'>On a sudden the whole character of the manuscript changed;
the delicate writing grew abrupt and broken; wild dashes
appeared where sentences should have been, and a spirit of sadness
pervaded every written word. She no longer spoke of
Lord Clare with the exulting love that had, at first, marked
her record; and every time her child was mentioned, the name
seemed written in tears. Still it was but the shadow of unhappiness
that appeared. No broad mention of discontent was
written, but a foreboding of evil, a dread of impending bereavement
fell upon the heart with every sentence.</p>

<p class='c014'>At last it came. Lord Clare, her husband, loved another—had
loved another long before he found her, a poor Gitanilla,
in the ruins of the Alhambra.</p>

<p class='c014'>With what a burst of anguish the truth was written! How
terrible it must have looked, glaring on her in words formed by
her own hand! Poor thing—she had attempted to dash the
sentence out, but the quivering hand had only scattered it with
blots; soiling the records as with mourning, but not obliterating
a single word.</p>

<p class='c014'>After this, there was no connection between the wild snatches
of anguish—the pathetic despair—the pleadings for a return
of love which were written in all the eloquence of desperation,
and blistered with tears that stained its surface yet.</p>

<p class='c014'>Trouble blinded my eyes as I read. My hands trembled as
they grasped the paper on which her tears had fallen. My
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>soul was full of my mother—tortured by her grief—swelling
fiercely with a bitter sense of her wrongs.</p>

<p class='c014'>I read on to the end. All my mother’s history was before
me—I saw her as she described herself, a wild dancing girl of
Granada, thrown upon the notice of a romantic and imaginative
young man—that gipsy marriage in the caverns of the Alhambra
was before me in all its dismal terrors. Was it a marriage,
or a deception by which my mother was betrayed?
Whatever it was, <em>she</em> believed it to be real. No doubt that she
was Lord Clare’s wife ever appeared, but, in the last page, the
cry of her wronged love broke out in one fierce burst of sorrow.
The certainty that he loved another—had never entirely loved
her—uprooted the very fibres of life. She never wrote rationally
after that.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I will go,” she wrote, and great drops as of rain blotted
out half the words—“I will go to him once more, and tell him
of my oath. Surely, surely he will not let me die—me, his
wife, his poor Gitanilla, whose beauty is not all gone yet. This
woman, does she love him as I do? Will she give up?—oh,
Heaven forgive me, I gave up nothing! What had I to yield,
a poor, dancing gipsy, with nothing on earth that was her own,
but the beauty of which he is tired, and the heart he is breaking?
But she, this woman with one husband in the grave—what
can she offer that Aurora did not give? Still, oh, misery,
misery, he loves her—I can see it. He thinks me blind, unconscious,
content with the sparse hours that he deals out grudgingly
to me and my child. Content! well, well, it may not be.
I have read of jealous hearts that create by wayward suspicions
the evil they dread. What if I were one of them? Oh, heavens,
what happiness if it rested thus with me! Let me hope—let
me hope!&#160;*&#160;*&#160;*&#160;*</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is over, he has struck my child—the blow has reached
my heart. <em>She</em> is at his dwelling—I too will enter it—I too
will strike. Have I not sworn an oath that must be redeemed?
<em>His</em> oath is forgotten. The gipsies remember better.&#160;*&#160;*&#160;*</p>

<p class='c014'>“She sleeps in his house to-night; I will be there! How
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>wakeful the child is! How wild and fiery are the eyes with
which she has been watching me from that heap of cushions!
They are closed, and I will steal away. But how come back?
Will it be the last time?&#160;*&#160;*&#160;*&#160;*</p>

<p class='c014'>“I have seen them both—he has told me all. He never
loved me as he loved her, not even then, among those ruins.
Never loved me! O, my God! am I mad to repeat these
words over and over, as the suicide, frantic with the first blow,
plunges the dagger again and again in his bosom? Why cannot
words kill like daggers? They pierce deeper—they torture
worse; but we live. Yes, if this pang could not wrench life
away, nothing can reach this stubborn hold on existence. He
has said it with his own lips—I am not loved—through all his
life that woman has ever stood between me and him. I rose
from my knees then and stood up. Did I entreat? No, no!
Perhaps he expected it—perhaps he thought the abject gipsy
blood would creep to his feet yet.&#160;*&#160;*&#160;*&#160;*</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why was Zana waiting in the darkness of that house?
How much her eyes looked like those of my grandame. Ha!
my oath. It is well I kept silent there. Have I not sworn
that nothing but death shall separate us two? Let them live,
the despised gipsy has the courage to die. Zana, my child,
gather up your strength, many dreary miles stretch between us
and the caves of Granada, but death is there. Without his
love, my poor little one, what can we do but die?”&#160;*&#160;*&#160;*</p>

<p class='c014'>Here the manuscript ended. But upon one of its blank
pages was written, in another hand, words that froze the tears
in my heart.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was a stern command to forsake the people of my father’s
blood; and after avenging my mother’s death, return to my
own tribe for ever. The words were strong with bitter hate,
that seemed to burn into the paper on which they were written.
The fearful document was signed <span class='sc'>Papita</span>.</p>

<p class='c014'>The papers dropped from my hand. I remember sitting, like
one stupefied, gazing down upon a pile of gold that nearly filled
the coffer, fascinated by the glitter of two antique ear-rings, set
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>with great rubies, that glowed out from the mass like huge
drops of blood that had petrified there. I took them up and
clasped them in my ears; their history was written out in the
manuscript I had just read; and I locked them with a sort of
awe. They seemed a fearful link that was to drag me back to
my people.</p>

<p class='c014'>While I searched among the gold for some other token, a
strange stupor crept over me, and I fell exhausted on the floor,
folding my arms over the bronze box and its contents.</p>

<p class='c014'>I slept heavily for hours, so heavily that all the sweet noises
of morning failed to arouse me. This suspension of consciousness
probably saved me from a brain fever, or perhaps utter
frenzy. It seems that I had locked myself in, and all day
Maria, unconscious of my return, had not thought of looking
for me till Turner came home, for a moment, to inquire after
us. He found Jupiter still saddled, wandering around the wilderness,
hungry and forlorn enough. This excited his fears,
and, directly, the faithful old man was knocking at my chamber
door. The noise was not enough to arouse me, and receiving
no answer he grew desperate, and forcing an entrance, found
me prone upon the carpet with my arms around the bronze coffer,
my soiled garments lying in torn masses around me, and my
pale features gleaming out from beneath the scarlet kerchief,
with which I had confined the riding-hat to my head.</p>

<p class='c014'>The stillness of death itself was not more profound than the
sleep into which I had fallen; but at last the gushes of fresh
air they let in upon me, aromatic vinegars, and the desperate
shake that Turner gave me in his terror, had their effect. I
stood up, stiffened in every limb and in a sort of trance; for all
consciousness was locked like ice in my bosom.</p>

<p class='c014'>Slowly, and with many pangs, the remembrance of what had
happened came back to me. The bronze coffer at my feet—the
sight of my garments, brought back a consciousness of all
that I had learned and suffered during the night. I took up
the coffer and placed it, reverently, on a table. Turner and
Maria watched me, with anxious curiosity. The box was a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>singular one, and covered with Egyptian hieroglyphics, into
which the red soil of the bank had introduced itself. I took
no heed of Turner’s astonishment; but, self-centred and stern,
asked him if Lord Clare—I did not call him father—still lived.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes,” answered the old man, and all his features commenced
to quiver, “he lives—he has asked for you again and again.
Where have you been, Zana?”</p>

<p class='c014'>I did not reply. The stern duty that lay upon me hardened
all my senses; the old man’s right to question me passed for
nothing. I asked what time it was, as if he had not spoken.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was four in the afternoon. Lord Clare had inquired for
me so often, that Turner determined, spite of Lady Catherine’s
prohibition, to bring me to his presence.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Go,” said the old man, gently—“go change that dress, and
drive, if it is possible, that deathly white from your cheek;
there is no resemblance now between you and <em>her</em>; that icy
face will disappoint him. Look like yourself, Zana—like
<em>her</em>!”</p>

<p class='c014'>I went at his bidding and changed my dress, and braided my
hair with fingers as stiff and, it seemed to me, as nerveless as
iron. The pallor did not leave my cheek; the blood flowed
still and icily in my veins; all the sweet impulses of humanity
seemed dead within me. I remembered a scarlet ribbon which
lay in the box, with a piece of gold attached. The journal had
given me its history. The gold was my father’s first gift to his
gipsy wife. I remembered well finding the ribbon in his vest,
and carrying it away with a sharp infantile struggle, full of glee
and baby triumph. He allowed me to keep it. Yet it was her
dearest maiden ornament—the earliest sacrifice that she had
made to him. The event was impressed on my mind, because
it brought forth the first angry word that I ever remember
from my mother. On seeing me come forward, holding up the
ribbon, and shouting as it floated behind me, I remember well
the quick flash of her eyes, the eager bound which she made
toward me, and the clutch of her hand as she wrested away my
treasure.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>My father laughed lightly at the struggle, but she bore the
ribbon away, and did not appear again for hours.</p>

<p class='c014'>As this memory pressed upon my mind, I entered the room
where Turner awaited me, took out the ribbon, and hung it
with the gold around my neck.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Do I look like <em>her</em> now?” I said, turning upon the old man
with steady coldness.</p>

<p class='c014'>He did not reply. His distended eyes were fixed on the
antique rings in my ears—a sort of terror possessed him at the
sight.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Zana, where did you get those accursed things?” he said.</p>

<p class='c014'>I did not answer, but took my mother’s journal from the
coffer and closed the lid over the gold.</p>

<p class='c014'>Turner followed me from the room, evidently filled with awe
by the cold stateliness of my demeanor.</p>

<p class='c014'>With a heart harder than the nether millstone, I entered the
house which held my dying father. No misgivings of humanity
possessed me—my soul was cruel in its purpose, and my footsteps
fell like iron upon the tessellated vestibule.</p>

<p class='c014'>Upon the staircase we met Lady Catherine Irving. She confronted
me with her impatient wrath and ordered me back,
denouncing Turner for having introduced me a second time
against her commands. I listened till she had done, and then
sternly pursued my way, leaving Turner behind.</p>

<p class='c014'>I opened the door of Lord Clare’s chamber. A voice from
the bed, feeble and sharp as that of an old man, called
out:</p>

<p class='c014'>“Turner, Turner, is it you? Have you found the child?”</p>

<p class='c014'>I strode up to the bed and bent over the dying man. My
hair almost touched his forehead. The glow of his great, feverish
eyes spread, like fire, over my face.</p>

<p class='c014'>When he saw me that sharp face began to quiver, and over
each cheek there darted a burning spot, as if a red rose leaf
had unfurled upon it. He lifted his long arms, and would have
clasped them over my neck, but they fell back, quivering, upon
the bed. With his lips drawn apart, and the glitter of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>eyes growing fearful, he lay gazing at the ruby rings that
weighed down my ears.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Those, those!—the rubies! How came they here?—what
demon has locked them into those ears? Out with them,
Zana—out with them, they are accursed!”</p>

<p class='c014'>He held up those pale hands and grasped eagerly at the ear-rings;
but I drew back, standing upright by his bed.</p>

<p class='c014'>“They are my inheritance,” I said; “touch them not.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“They are accursed,” he faltered, struggling to his elbow,
“the symbols of treachery and blood—they were in <em>her</em> ears—the
sorceress—the poisoner—they were in her ears that night.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I know it. They belonged to old Papita, the grandame
of my mother, the Gitanilla whom you married in the vaults of
the Alhambra. I am her child.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And mine!” he cried, casting up his arms as he fell backward
upon the pillows.</p>

<p class='c014'>I drew back, repulsing those quivering arms with a motion
of my hand. They fell heavily upon the bed-clothes. A groan
burst from his lips, and, from beneath his closed eyelids, I saw
two great tears roll slowly downward.</p>

<p class='c014'>For one moment the heart within me was stirred with an impulse
of compassion. I removed the red ribbon from my neck
and flung it over his, the pure offering of my soul. He grasped
the gold with both hands and held it against his heart, muttering
faint prayers to himself. I took one of the pale hands in
mine; the touch softened me still more. The word father trembled
on my lips—another moment and I must have fallen on my
knees by his side. But that instant Lady Catherine Irving
laid her hand on my arm.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Go!” she said, in a hoarse whisper. “Insolent, begone!”</p>

<p class='c014'>I shook off her detested touch and drew myself sternly up.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Hence, woman!” I exclaimed, pointing to the door with my
hand—“hence; and leave me alone with my father!”</p>

<p class='c014'>She turned livid with rage, but kept her ground, attempting
to force me from the bed; but she might as well have tried her
puny strength on a rock.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>“Catherine, go, it is my child,” said a faint voice from the
bed; “leave us together.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is against the physician’s orders—his mind wanders—it
is madness!” exclaimed the woman, addressing Turner, who followed
her; “you will bear witness, good Turner, that at the
last his mind wandered.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Lord Clare’s eyes opened, and were bent, with a look of ineffable
love, upon my face.</p>

<p class='c014'>“My child—my child!” he murmured, repeating the name
as if the sound were sweet to him. Then looking at Turner, he
whispered, “There must be some new proof. Those rings, take
them from her—for, before the God of heaven, she is my own
child.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“He raves—he is insane!” cried Lady Catherine, attempting
to push me aside.</p>

<p class='c014'>I have said that my heart was hard as a rock when I entered
that chamber. A moment of tenderness had softened it, but
the presence of this woman petrified it again. Still I could not
share in this unholy strife around my father’s death-bed without
a shudder. My very soul revolted from the contest which
might ensue if I persisted in remaining. I took the hand which
had been feebly extended toward me, and pressed the journal
of my mother into its clasp. He lifted up the papers, held
them waving before his eyes, and muttering, “It is hers—it is
hers!” cowered down into the bed and began to moan.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What papers are those?” almost shrieked Lady Catherine,
attempting to possess them, but the dying man dragged them
beneath the bed-clothes. “It is forbidden him to read—he
shall not attempt it!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Lord Clare started up in bed, and pointed his long, shadowy
finger toward the door.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Woman,” he cried, in a voice that made her creep slowly
backward—“woman, intermeddle no more—leave me with these
papers and my God!”</p>

<p class='c014'>The astonished and terrified woman crept abjectly from the
room, with her pallid face averted.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>Lord Clare sat upright, unfolding the yellow and time-stained
journal of my mother with his shaking hands.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Fling back the curtains,” he cried. “Nay, nay, my eyes are
dim—bring lights—bring lights. Ha, yes, that is the sunset,
let me read it by the last sun I shall ever see!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Turner had drawn back the bed curtains, twisting them in
masses around the heavy ebony posts. But this was not enough,
with a sweep of his arms he sent all the glowing silk away from
the nearest window, letting in a burst of the golden sunset.</p>

<p class='c014'>And by this light my dying father began to read the records
of the heart he had broken. It was terrible to witness the
eagerness with which his glittering eyes ran over the paper.
New vitality had seized upon him: he sat upright and firm as
an oak in the bed, which had quivered to his nervous trembling
a few minutes before.</p>

<p class='c014'>I had entered the room determined to spare no pang to the
dying man—to shrink from nothing that might send back an
avenging torture for all that he had dealt to my mother, but I
was young and I was human. The blood that beat in his almost
pulseless heart flowed in my veins also. I could not look upon
him there—so pale, so full of deathly beauty—and be his executioner.
I turned away resolved to spare him the details of
my mother’s death. I met Lady Catherine again upon the
stairs, and she shrunk back from me as if I had been a viper.
It gave me no pain—I was scarcely conscious of her presence.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XLV.<br> <span class='large'>THE SHADOWY DEATH-CHAMBER.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>I awoke in the night from a broken and unhealthy sleep.
Turner’s voice, and the tramp of Jupiter outside my window
had aroused me. I raised the sash, and looked out in time to
see the old man throw himself on Jupiter’s back and ride swiftly
away. Just then the clock chimed three.</p>

<p class='c014'>I could not sleep again. A remembrance of the scene by my
father’s death-bed—the knowledge that now he had full proof
that I was indeed his child, came with startling acuteness to my
mind. I reflected that in that house my mother had lived her
brief period of happiness, and known the anguish that at last
drove her to death. Never had I felt her memory so keenly,
or her presence so near. A craving desire to draw my soul
closer to hers by material things seized upon me. The room
which I could remember her to have occupied, and that
had been so often alluded to in her journal, had never been
opened since she left it. Turner and Maria avoided the very
passage which led to it, and I had shared somewhat in this
spirit of avoidance. Now a desire possessed me to visit that
room. The key was lost, Turner had often told me that, but
bolts were of little consequence to me then. I dressed hurriedly
and let myself into the garden. Around the old stone balcony
the vines had run riot for years, weaving themselves around the
heavy balustrades in fantastic and leafy masses.</p>

<p class='c014'>I tore these vines asunder, laying the old steps bare and scattering
them with dead leaves, as I made my way to the balcony,
which was literally choked up with the silky tufts of the clematis
vines, run to seed, and passion flowers out of blossom.
The nails, grown rusty in the hinges, gave way as I pulled at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>the shutters closed for years and years. Then the sash-door
yielded before me, and I stood in the room my mother had
inhabited; and for the first time trod its floor since she left it
on that bitter, bitter night. How well I remembered it! Then I
had stood by her side a little child; now I was a woman alone
in its desolation. I sat down in the darkness till the first tints
of dawn revealed all its dreary outlines. A pile of cushions lay
at my feet, and gleams of the original crimson came up through
the dust. On those cushions I had crouched, watching her
through my half-shut lashes as she sat in the easy-chair, meditating
her last appeal to the merciless heart of her husband.</p>

<p class='c014'>A cashmere shawl, moth-eaten, and, with its gorgeous tints
almost obliterated, hung over the chair, sweeping the dim carpet
with its dusty fringes. Pictures gleamed around me through
a veil of dust; and vases full of dead flowers stood on the mosaic
tables. When I touched the leaves they crumbled to powder
beneath my fingers. I beat the cushions free from their defacement,
and reverently shook out the folds of my mother’s shawl.
These were the objects she had touched last, and to me they
were sacred. The rest I left in its dreariness, glad that time
and creeping insects had spread a pall over them.</p>

<p class='c014'>Seated in her chair, I watched the dawn break slowly over
the garden. It seemed as if I were waiting for something—as
if some object, sacred to her memory, had called me to that
room, and placed me in that chair. It was a dull morning.
Tints that should have been rosy took a pale violet hue in
the east. The birds were beginning to wake up, but as yet
they only moved dreamily in the leaves. No wind was astir,
and the shadows of night still lay beneath the trees of the wilderness.
The stillness around was funereal.</p>

<p class='c014'>Unconsciously I listened. Yet whom could I expect? What
human being ever entered that room sacred to the memory of
one unhappy woman?</p>

<p class='c014'>At length there came upon this stillness a sound that would
have startled another, but I sat motionless and waited. It was
like the struggling of some animal through the flower thickets—the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>unequal tread of footsteps—short pauses and quick
gasps of breath. Then a feeble sound of some one clambering
up the steps, and there, upon the balcony, stood my father.</p>

<p class='c014'>My heart ceased to beat; for the universe I could not have
moved or spoken. He was dressed so strangely, his under garments
all white as snow, with that gorgeous gown of Damascus
silk flowing over. His head was bare, and the locks curled
over the pallid forehead, crisped with a dampness that I afterwards
knew was the death sweat.</p>

<p class='c014'>He stood within the window, with those great, burning eyes
bent on me. Their look was unearthly—their brightness terrible;
but there was no shrinking in my heart. I hardened
under it as steel answers to the flame.</p>

<p class='c014'>After shaking the dust from my mother’s shawl, I had laid it
back upon the chair as it was at first; but when I sat down
the folds were disturbed, and fell around my shoulders, till,
unconsciously, I had been draped with them much as was
my mother’s custom. Thus I appeared before her husband and
my father, ignorant of the appalling likeness that struck his
dying heart to the centre.</p>

<p class='c014'>He stood for a whole minute in the sheltered window, never
turning his eyes a moment from my face. Then with a feeble
stillness, taking each step as a child begins to walk, he glided
toward me, and, sinking on his knees at my feet, took my two
hands softly in his, and laid his damp forehead upon them.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Aurora—Aurora, forgive me, forgive her—I am dying—I
am dying!—she wronged you unconsciously.”</p>

<p class='c014'>It sounds in the depths of my soul yet—the pathetic anguish
of those words! I could not move: my lips clung together:
a stillness like that of the grave fell over us both. He had
taken me, the implacable child, for the wronged mother; his
cold lips lay passive upon my hands, and I had no power to
fling them off.</p>

<p class='c014'>He meekly lifted his head. Those burning eyes were filled
with tears, in which they seemed to float like stars reflected in
water.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>“You will not speak it, Aurora, and I am dying?” he murmured,
clasping his arms over my neck, and drawing his head
upward to my bosom, till I could feel the sharp, quick pants of
his heart close to mine. “I have been years and years searching
for the thing forgiveness; and now when your lips alone
can speak it, they will not! I am waiting, Aurora—but you
will not let me die! To wait is torture—but you will not
speak!”</p>

<p class='c014'>O my God, forgive me! but the black blood of Egypt
rose like gall in the bottom of my heart, when he spoke of torture
in that prayerful, broken-hearted manner. I forgot him,
though he lay heavy as death upon my bosom, and thought
only of the real torture under which she, for whom I was mistaken,
had perished. My heart rose hard and strong, repelling
the feeble flutter of his with the heave of an iron shaft.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is not Aurora—I am not your gipsy wife, Lord Clare,
but her child—the foundling of your servant—the scoff of your
whole race. I am Zana!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Zana!” he repeated, lifting his eyes with a bewildered and
mournful look, “that was our child; but Aurora, how many
times shall I ask where is she? Have I not come all this
weary way to find her? Where is she, Zana?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I gave you her journal,” I said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, yes, I have it here under my vest: you will find it by
and by, but let it be a little while. She, Aurora, herself, this
writing is not forgiveness; and I say again, child, I am dying!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I have nothing but what she has written,” I answered,
shrinking from his questions as if they had been poniards.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But she does not tell all—not a word since that night.
She was going somewhere—she talked about dying, but that is
not easy, Zana—see how long I have been about it, and not
dead yet. Tell me what she has been doing since that miserable,
miserable night.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Ask her in Eternity!” I said, attempting to free myself
from his embrace. “If the dead forgive, ask forgiveness of her
there.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>He drew back upon his knees, supporting himself by the
marble pressure of his hands upon my arms.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Dead. Is Aurora dead?” fell in a whisper from his white
lips. “Is she waiting for me there?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“She is dead!” I answered.</p>

<p class='c014'>“When, how, where did she die?” he questioned, with sudden
energy, and a glitter of the eye that burned away all the
tears.</p>

<p class='c014'>I hesitated one minute—an evasion was on my lips. I could
not tell him how his victim had died; it was striking a poniard
into the last struggles of waning life. Suffering from the
agony of his look I turned my head away; the fringe of my
mother’s shawl caught in the ruby ear-rings that were swayed
by the motion. A fiery pain shot through my temple; the
gipsy blood ran hot and bitterly in my veins. His voice was
in my ear again, feeble, but commanding.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Speak—how did Aurora die?”</p>

<p class='c014'>The answer sprung like burning lava to my lips. I forgot
that it was a dying man to whom I spoke. My words have
rung back to my own soul ever since, clear and sharp as
steel.</p>

<p class='c014'>“<em>Your wife—my mother—was stoned to death by her tribe in
the snow mountains back of Granada!</em>”</p>

<p class='c014'>My father sprang to his feet. For a moment he stood up,
stiff and stark, like a marble shaft: then he reeled forward and
fell prone upon the cushions, with a cry that made every nerve
in my body quake.</p>

<p class='c014'>That cry, that prostrate form, O God forgive me! barbarian
that I was—my voice had smitten him to the soul. I, his
only child, had fiendishly hurled him down to die! I looked
upon him where he lay, ghastly and quivering, like a shot
eagle, among the cushions. All the sweet memories of my
infancy came back: a remembrance of the first tender kisses
those lips had pressed on my forehead, seemed burning there
in curses of my cruelty. I knelt down beside him, humbled to
the dust, racked with an anguish so scathing, that while I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>longed to perish by his side, it seemed as if I were doomed to
live on forever and ever.</p>

<p class='c014'>I felt a shudder creep over his limbs as I bent over and
touched him.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Father, O my father!” I cried, in terrible anguish, “speak!
say that I have not killed you!”</p>

<p class='c014'>He did not speak; he did not move; his eyes were closed;
his pale hand lay nerveless upon the carpet. An awful chill
crept over me. I felt like a murderess stricken with the first
curse of my crime.</p>

<p class='c014'>Noises came from the balcony, people were scrambling up
the steps, probably aroused by that fearful cry. I heard Turner’s
voice—other persons were with him. One a professional-looking
man, who held a roll of paper in his hand; another
followed, carrying an inkstand bristling with pens. The first
man sat down by a table, upon which some vases stood, and,
unrolling a parchment, looked keenly at Turner.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Awake him gently, there is no time to lose; this terrible
effort must soon terminate all.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Turner knelt down by his master, and I drew back, waiting
breathlessly for him to speak; my very salvation seemed hanging
on his first word. How white he grew; how those old
hands shook as they touched the pale fingers that had fallen
over the cushion! It was a long time before that good old man
could master the tears that swelled to his throat. The stillness
was profound. No one stirred; the barrister sat with one
hand pressed on the will he had come to execute; the other
held the pen suspended motionless.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Will he sign now?” questioned the man, in a low voice;
“it is all that is wanting.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Turner stood up, and his white face was revealed to the barrister,
who began to roll up the parchment.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Good heavens, is it so?” he exclaimed, in a suppressed voice,
“and in this strange place.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“My master, O my master!” cried Turner, falling upon
his knees, and crying aloud in his anguish as he lifted the pale
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>hand of the dead, and laid it reverently on the still bosom, “oh,
would to God I had died for thee!”</p>

<p class='c014'>I looked on the old man with wonder and envy. He could
weep, but I was frozen into stone—he could touch the beloved
hand; I was afraid even to look that way. The curse of my
gipsy inheritance was upon me; the first act in the great drama
of vengeance was performed, and it had left me branded, heart
and soul. I sat cowering in the shadows like a criminal, not
like the avenger of a great wrong. I had built up walls of
granite between myself and the dead, I, his only child.</p>

<p class='c014'>The rush of all these thoughts on my brain stifled me. I
could no longer endure the presence of the living nor the dead,
but arose and descended into the garden. Turner followed me,
weeping, and evidently with a desire to comfort me. I, wishing
to avoid him, was still held by a sort of fascination under the
windows of the death-chamber. A litter stood beneath the
balcony, on which a mattress had been placed; I knew what it
was for, and lingered near it with my eyes uplifted to the room
above. There was a faint conversation, smothered whispers,
and a muffled tread of feet upon the carpet.</p>

<p class='c014'>I know not how or whence she came, but Maria stood by
me, with her hands clasped in the shock of a first terrible surprise,
tearless and hushed, a picture of mute sorrow. We were
both looking upward. We saw them as they lifted him from
the cushions, and bore him forward over the trampled vines to
the broken steps. The faces of these men wore a look of stern
sorrow. They descended, very slowly, while Turner stood
below with arms uplifted, prepared to receive the dead.</p>

<p class='c014'>The men paused, half way down the steps, to free a portion
of the Oriental gown which had entangled itself in the balustrade.
Just then, a first beam of the sunrise fell across that
marble face. Oh, how beautiful it was! how mournfully beautiful!
Dim blue shadows lay around the closed eyelids. The
deathly white of the forehead gleamed out from the golden
auburn of his hair and beard, which the sunshine struck aslant,
and the wind softly stirred in terrible contrast with the stillness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>of the face and limbs. A look of holy quiet, more heavenly
than a smile, hovered around his mouth; the very winds of
morning seemed unholy for disturbing the solemn stillness that
lay upon him.</p>

<p class='c014'>Once more I passed the threshold of my father’s house—the
threshold upon which I had slept a child-beggar and an infant
outcast; for the first time I trod over the spot not only without
bitterness, but in humility of soul. I followed the dead
body of my father, whose love I had repulsed, whose repentance
I had rejected. That one idea drove all the evil blood from
my heart. I would have crept after him on my knees before
every proud remnant of his race, could the act have appeased
this thought within me.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was early in the morning, so early that not even a servant
was astir. The men trod lightly over the marble vestibule and
up the broad staircase; after that thick carpets muffled their
steps; and thus our mournful group entered Lord Clare’s chamber
without disturbing a soul in the house.</p>

<p class='c014'>Even young Morton, that had been left to watch with him
when old Turner went away, was not aroused from the deep
slumber which had overtaken him, in an easy-chair wheeled to a
remote corner of the room.</p>

<p class='c014'>Life had passed out, and death entered the room, while that
man slept on his post.</p>

<p class='c014'>They laid my father on his bed, and then gathered in a group
near the window, pallid and anxious, conversing together. At
times whispers are more distinct than words. I heard all. The
lawyer had a parchment roll still in his hand. Turner looked
wistfully at it, then at me.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, it is of no more value than blank paper,” said the lawyer,
answering the look; “and worse, the old will, which would
have given Marston Court to young Morton, its rightful
owner, was destroyed in anticipation of this. Lady Catherine
sweeps every thing!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It was not that,” said Turner, “but his memory; let it be
saved from idle gossip. It is only known to us that my lord left
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>this room last night. Why make the manner or place of his
death a wonder for people that have no right to inquire
about it?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“We can be silent,” answered the lawyer, looking at his clerk.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Do, for the sake of all who loved him; and this parchment,
it is useless; let us forget it. We know that his last wish was
to provide for her poor, poor child.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Turner beckoned that I should advance, as he spoke.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Zana,” he said, taking the parchment, “<em>he</em> would have
made you rich. In this will, he left a large property to you;
had he lived only a few minutes longer, all would have been
well. But God, who has made you an orphan, leaves you still
with old Turner. In this will, and to me also, Lord Clare
admits you to be his child. Shall it be so proclaimed? So
far the secret rests with us. Shall we darken his memory
with it?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Oh, how thankful I was for this power to atone in a little for
the cruelty of my acts! For the first time that day tears came
to my eyes.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Save his memory,” I said; “let me remain an outcast. No
word or look of mine shall darken his name.”</p>

<p class='c014'>This resolution reconciled me somewhat to myself. I stole
toward the bed, and through my tears gazed upon that marble
face.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, my father, can you hear me?” I murmured. “It is
your child—not the demon who refused to forgive—but you
<em>are</em> forgiven. In eternity you have seen the wronged one, and
instead of curses she has filled your immortality with blessings.
I see them upon this face, that in its ineffable calm forgives even
me, who was implacable.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The broken sobs and murmurs in which I uttered these
words of grief awoke young Morton, who arose and came
toward the window. Turner advanced.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Let some one arouse the family, the Earl of Clare is dead.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Morton turned deathly pale, and almost staggered as he
went out to perform this mournful duty.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XLVI.<br> <span class='large'>A VISIT TO MY ARCH ENEMY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Directly the chamber was filled. Weeping domestics
crowded the ante-room. Lady Catherine and her son stood by
the death couch; the mother lost in noisy grief; the young
man white and tearless as the dead face upon which he gazed.</p>

<p class='c014'>As Lady Catherine removed the embroidered handkerchief
from her face, her eyes fell upon me where I stood by the
window near the strange lawyer. Her face flushed, and she
came toward us.</p>

<p class='c014'>“How long has this girl been in Lord Clare’s chamber?
How dare she insult our grief by intruding here?”</p>

<p class='c014'>She spoke hurriedly, casting eager glances at the parchment
which the lawyer still held.</p>

<p class='c014'>“She came with me—she saw him when he died,” answered
the old man.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And were you here also?” questioned Lady Catherine,
sharply, of the lawyer.</p>

<p class='c014'>He bowed.</p>

<p class='c014'>The lady forgot her tears and the grief, which, at first, had
disturbed the sacred quiet of that death-chamber.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Did he send for you?” she continued.</p>

<p class='c014'>“He did, my lady.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And for her?” she cried, with a disdainful wave of the
hand toward me.</p>

<p class='c014'>“His last wish was to see her.”</p>

<p class='c014'>This evasive, but lawyer-like reply, irritated her afresh.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What is that in your hand?” she cried; and taking even
this wary man by surprise, she reached forth her hand, secured
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>the parchment, and eagerly unrolled it. She began to read;
her thin lips grew almost imperceptible; and her light blue
eyes, the most cruel color on earth, when filled with malice,
became repulsive as those of a venomous reptile. They darted
from line to line, growing fiercer and more hideous each instant,
till her face became perfectly colorless.</p>

<p class='c014'>At last her eyes dropped to the bottom of the document, a
glare of delight shot from them, and striking the parchment
with her open hands, she looked round upon us, with a smile of
triumphant malice, horrible in that place and presence.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is not signed—it was not his work, but yours!” she
cried, forgetting all respect for the dead in her fiendish
exultation. “Go forth, one and all, your presence here is an
insult!”</p>

<p class='c014'>She waved her hand haughtily. But the lawyer and his
clerk alone answered it. She still pointed her finger toward
the door. Turner withstood the gesture firmly, but still with
that respect which men of his class habitually render to those
of superior station.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Madam,” he said, “you have seen it written by his own
order that this young girl was Lord Clare’s Child. Surely it
cannot be that you wish her sent altogether from his dwelling
while he is lying there?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I deny it; there is no proof that she is his child,” she
retorted, pale with anger, and casting a furtive look at the bed,
as if she feared those marble lips might move and contradict
her. “What proof is there in an unsigned paper drawn up at
a distance, and without his knowledge?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Before God and before the dead!” answered Turner, looking
upward, and then bowing his forehead solemnly toward the
death couch, “Clarence, Lord Clare, told me with his own lips,
not twelve hours ago, that this child, Zana, was his daughter,
proven so entirely to his satisfaction. By his orders, and at
his dictation, I took down all that is in that unsigned will,
and myself carried it to the lawyer, who hastened to put it in
form.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>“It is false; had this been true Lord Clare would have
signed it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“He was dead when we came back,” answered Turner.</p>

<p class='c014'>I saw her lips move, those thin, pale lips made a movement,
as if they would have said, “Thank God!” But in the awful
presence of death she dared not force them to utter the blasphemy
in words.</p>

<p class='c014'>All this time George Irving had been so overwhelmed
by the sudden shock of his uncle’s death, that he seemed
entirely unconscious of what was passing. But at last the
sharp tones of his mother’s voice aroused him, and he came
forward with one hand slightly uplifted. “Hush!” he said,
“this is no place for words.”</p>

<p class='c014'>His mother looked at him with a half sneer.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Do you know that this creature and her miserable old
father have been plotting to disgrace our name, to steal away
your birthright, George?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I only know that we are in the presence of death,”
answered the young man, solemnly. “Madam, let me lead you
away, this agitation will make you ill.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No—not while these vipers remain,” she answered.</p>

<p class='c014'>This scene had, from the first, wounded me as if every word
had been a blow; but my heart received as a blessing every
fresh pang, for it seemed as if by pain I could make atonement
for all I had inflicted on the dead. But I could now no longer
endure it. Without a word, and with one mournful glance at
the beautiful marble that had been my father, I went forth
alone. Turner resisted; not all the malice of that bad woman
could move him from the side of that death couch—command
and insult were alike futile. Until the day of the funeral the
old man remained by his master, still as a shadow, faithful as
truth.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was a miserable time with me after this. I wandered
around that dwelling like a haunting and haunted spirit. They
had laid my father out in state, and the meanest villager could
pass in and look upon him; but I, his only child, driven away
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>like a dog, could only look upon the walls that held him afar
off, and through blinding tears. Still I said to myself it is
right. Let me have patience with this cruelty—I who would
not be merciful, who refused forgiveness, as if I were a god to
judge and avenge, should learn to suffer. With the memory
of his death green in my heart, I thought that the bitterness of
my nature was all gone, and gloried like a martyr in the persecutions
that threatened me.</p>

<p class='c014'>At last I grew weary with watching. Maria strove to comfort
me, but her own kind heart was full of grief, and we could
only weep together and wish for old Turner.</p>

<p class='c014'>But we had friends who did not quite forsake us, though it
was known that even sympathy in our sorrow would be held as
a cause of offence with Lady Catherine, who was now a peeress
in her own right, and lady of Greenhurst.</p>

<p class='c014'>The curate and my precious Cora came to us at once. They
had seen Turner at his post, and knowing the danger, came
without concealment to comfort us. Cora did not seem well.
Her sweet mouth was unsteady, as if with more than sudden
grief. Those pale blue shadows lay beneath her beautiful eyes,
that I could never see without a feeling that an overflow of
tears had left them there.</p>

<p class='c014'>She was very gentle, and affectionate as a child, striving
with her pretty ways and sweet words to win me from the
sternness of my grief. I felt this gratefully, but had no power
to express the sense that I really felt of her kindness. As one
answers and feels the pity of a child, I received the sympathy
that she came to give. Would that it had been otherwise,
would that I had treated her as a woman full of rich, shy,
womanly feelings; in that time of confidence and tears she
might have been won to trust in me entirely. But there was
the old feeling of suspicion in my heart. We shared our tears
together, but nothing else. The sweet, motherless girl had no
encouragement to open her heart, even if it had been her wish.
In the selfishness of my grief I forgot everything else.</p>

<p class='c014'>With Mr. Clark it was otherwise. His counsels, his gentleness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>and patience were so true, so beautifully sincere, that I
could not but yield to them. I told him all—my night at
Marston Court, the papers which Chaleco had unearthed, and
my last, cruel interview with Lord Clare. But the good man
could give me no counsel here. His life had been too isolate,
too tranquil for power to cope with, or even understand these
wild events. He was shocked by the revengeful character of
Chaleco, and urged me with tears never to see this man
again.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Come to us,” said the good man—“come and learn to love
God peacefully with Cora and your old friend. The little parsonage
is large enough; it held three once, you know,” he
added, with tender mournfulness; “and I sometimes think
Cora still pines for her mother, as I do. Our home is very sad
of late years, and you seldom come now, Zana.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I will come to you more than ever if they will let me,” I
answered, touched by his sadness, and filled with remorse, for
having, in a great degree, forsaken his dwelling the moment a
jealous doubt of Cora entered my mind.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Drive all this wild man’s advice from your mind,” continued
he; “see how it embittered the last moments of your father’s
life—those precious moments which God had bestowed that
they might be filled with paternal blessings. Flee from this
evil man, Zana.”</p>

<p class='c014'>There was something in the simplicity and gentleness with
which this advice was given that touched my heart; while a
haughty faith in my own more daring character made me
receive it with forbearance rather than respect. But just then
all opposition was passive in my bosom. I was silent, and he
thought me convinced.</p>

<p class='c014'>In some things this strangely good man was full of resolution,
strong in courage. When I expressed a wish to see my
father again, before the tomb was closed on him forever, he
offered at once to lead me to his side. I did not dream that
this act of Christian courage would harm him, though <em>he</em> knew
it well enough. It was a fatal step, but how could I comprehend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>that the hatred sure to follow me would be felt by all who
regarded my forlorn state with kindness?</p>

<p class='c014'>I saw my father once more in the dead of night, when no one
watched beside him save old Turner. Mr. Clark went with
me, and the two men, my sole supporters on earth, left me
alone in the funeral chamber.</p>

<p class='c014'>I will not attempt to describe the anguish, the sting of conscience
which held me chained to that death couch. I knelt
beneath the dim rays of light that gleamed like starbeams
among the black draperies, and made an effort to pray. Was
it my imagination, or did those fearful rubies burn in my ears?
I <em>could not pray</em>.</p>

<p class='c014'>As I rose from my knees with an oppression on my chest and
brain, that held me as in fetters of iron, the masses of black
velvet that fell from the tall ebony couch on which the lord of
Greenhurst was laid, shook heavily, parted, and in the dusky
opening I saw the head of Chaleco. The face was half in
shadow, but those eyes and the gleaming teeth were full of
sinister triumph.</p>

<p class='c014'>He reached forth one hand, removed the linen from Lord
Clare’s face, and whispered in his native Rommany.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Look on your mother’s murderer, woman of the Caloes—look
for the last time. He has covered your face with shame,
driven you forth from his people. Come to us, it is time. The
tribes of Granada know that the true blood has avenged itself
here. They will recognize those symbols of Papita, their prophetess—they
will forgive the base blood in your heart, and you
shall be a queen to them. Chaleco promises.”</p>

<p class='c014'>With an effort that seemed like a wrench on every nerve in
my body, I turned away my eyes from the dark head of the
gipsy count, and they rested on the holy stillness of my father’s
death-sleep. The light gleamed over him; the sublime repose
of his features had deepened till he almost smiled. Contrasted
with that heavenly face, Chaleco seemed a demon tempting
me.</p>

<p class='c014'>I fell upon my knees once more. The weight left my brain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>and chest. Tears are sometimes sweeter and more holy than
prayer. I wept freely.</p>

<p class='c014'>When I arose, Chaleco stood beside me, but the power of his
fierce eyes was gone. The unnatural influence that he had
obtained over me was lost in the more sublime impressions left
by that tranquil face.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Go,” I said, gently; “I am not prepared to follow yet.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Wait till these gentiles spurn you away then!” he
answered, in a fierce whisper; “they will do it. No fear, I
can wait.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“God only knows what they will do,” I said; “but I was not
made for an avenger. Children do not turn and rend those
who gave them life. Look there, how he smiles, and yet
I killed him. You call this vengeance—it is murder!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Fool!” he exclaimed, “fool! but wait, wait!”</p>

<p class='c014'>He waved his hand toward me as if to forbid any movement;
and going to an antique cabinet which I remembered well,
began to search in its drawers. I saw him take out two or
three articles which he thrust in his bosom, then with a dark
look toward the bed he disappeared. I know not how, for when
I would have stopped his progress the velvet drapery swayed
between me and him, as if dashed down with a sweep of his
arm. When I searched behind that, he was gone.</p>

<p class='c014'>On the next day my father was buried. I did not attempt
to join the procession, or force myself on the notice of those
who had assembled to render the last honors to his memory.
Strangers could walk close by his bier; I looked on like a wild
animal through the thick trees that concealed me. It was a
bitter thought, and something of old resentments kept me
dumb as the funeral train swept by.</p>

<p class='c014'>I think it was three or four days after Lord Clare’s funeral,
when Turner received a message from the Hurst. He seemed
troubled, but made an evident effort to appear unconcerned. I
saw him go with misgivings, for late events had left me in a
state of nervousness that detected evils in every shadow. My
presentiments were right. Lady Clare, the new countess, before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>leaving for her London house, among some other old and favorite
servants, coldly ordered the old man away, unless he would
send me, her brother’s orphan, from beneath his roof. Other
changes were about to be made. The Marston Court living,
which had been vacant more than a year, and which controlled
that of Greenhurst, was given to Mr. Upham, who had taken
orders and would assume it at once. This man now held Cora’s
father in his power.</p>

<p class='c014'>Everywhere was I hedged in and surrounded by foes; an
Ishmaelitish feeling took possession of me amid my grief. The
only friends that clung to me on earth were driven forth like
dogs, because they gave me shelter. I knew well that Turner
would not hesitate; that he would beg by the wayside rather
than forsake the poor foundling he had cherished so long.</p>

<p class='c014'>But he was now an old man, united to a woman scarcely
more capable of working her way through ordinary life than a
child. Should I permit him to be thus unhoused and thrust
into new phases of life that I might share his little means of
comfort? He loved our beautiful old dwelling. To send him
from among the trees of that park would end like uprooting
the oldest oak there. Not for me—not for me should this be
done!</p>

<p class='c014'>But Cora and her father, they had offered me a share in that
pretty home by the church. This thought, for an instant, gave
me pleasure; but was not the good man also dependent on a
friend of Lady Catherine’s? I had almost said menial—for
the soul renders baser services, sometimes, than the bare hands
can give. Was not he also indirectly at the mercy of this new
countess?</p>

<p class='c014'>All night long I thought over these bitter reflections, and,
spite of myself, an indignant sense of oppression—cruel, undeserved
oppression, filled my soul. The iron of my nature broke
up through the soil that had covered it for a time. The sibyl’s
ear-rings grew precious to me. If cast out from one race, they
were burning links which drew me to the darker and fiercer
people, to whom persecution was an inheritance.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>I arose in the morning and went to Greenhurst. The countess
would have had me driven from her steps had I desired
admission; but, well aware of this, I entered alone, unannounced,
and made my way to her dressing-room.</p>

<p class='c014'>The contrasts in that woman’s character were most repulsive.
While her aims were all deep and cruel as the grave, their exhibition
was always toned down by conventionalisms. While
planning the ruin of a fellow creature, she would sit quietly
curling the hair of her lapdog, as if that only occupied her
mind.</p>

<p class='c014'>When I entered her presence, she rose hastily from the
depths of an easy-chair, in which she had been buried, and
arranged the folds of a violet silk dressing-gown, with what
seemed fastidious regard to the effect her delicate attempt at
mourning would have upon the young gipsy. I was surprised
at this. It seemed impossible that a woman so relentless
could occupy herself with trivial attempts at display like this.
Now, it seems the most natural thing on earth. Inordinate
vanity and a savage want of feeling have linked themselves
together through all history. The bad man or woman is almost
invariably a vain one.</p>

<p class='c014'>I think the woman took a mean pleasure in making her dog
bark at me, for her hand was playing about his ears, and a
hateful smile warped her lips as his snarling yelp died into a
howl.</p>

<p class='c014'>I took no heed, but walked up to her chair and rested one
hand upon it. She shrunk back.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Madam,” I said, “you have made it a condition with Mr.
Turner that he shall thrust me from his door. Because he
rejects this you wish to drive him from the estate. He refuses
no longer; I have come to inform you of this. To-morrow you
will have rendered your brother’s child homeless.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am glad,” said the woman, haughtily—“very glad that
Turner has come to his senses. No one wishes, of course, to
send him away; he is a good servant enough; but we cannot
make that pretty cottage a nest for impostors. So long as he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>lives there quietly and alone with his old wife, it does not
signify, though I had a fancy for tearing the place down. But
he must not harbor objectionable people; give him to understand
this before you go. Above all things, strolling gipsies
and their children must be kept from the estate. He will
understand!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Madam, have I your promise that Mr. Turner shall remain
in his old place so long as I keep from his house?” I questioned.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why, yes,” she answered, smoothing the dog’s ear over
her finger; “he is a good old man enough. No one will disturb
him, unless my son’s bride should take a distaste to his
ugliness when she comes down.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I received the sidelong glance of her eyes as she said this
without flinching, and she went on.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Estelle has fastidious fancies in such things. Now, I think
of it, she may be in want of a clever maid. Did she not
approve of your talent in that way, once? If the situation
would keep you from want, I have no earthly objection.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Madam!” said I, standing upright and speaking, as it were
a prophecy, for the words were not formed by a moment’s
thought—“madam, when I come back to Greenhurst, I shall
be its mistress, not a servant.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She turned white with rage, and clenched her fingers fiercely
among the thick curls of her spaniel, which lay crouched in her
lap, eyeing me like a rattlesnake.</p>

<p class='c014'>As I spoke, a low laugh reached my ear from a window;
and, for an instant, I saw the face of Chaleco looking in
through the curtains. Lady Clare cowered back in her seat,
frightened by the glance that I fixed upon her, by my words
and the fiendish glee of that laugh.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Go,” she said, at last, “leave the estate, you and your old
supporter; root and branch you shall all be exterminated.”</p>

<p class='c014'>A noise at the window, a flutter of silk, and Chaleco stood
by me.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, madam,” he said, “<em>she</em> shall go because it is the will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>of her people; but as for that old man, touch but the dog he
loves at your peril!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What are you?” faltered the lady, gathering up her
spaniel in an agony of terror. “How came you in this
place?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I have been here before,” said Chaleco.</p>

<p class='c014'>“When?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“On the night Lord Clare’s wife died.” He stooped down
whispering the words in her ear. “If a hair of that old
man’s head suffers for his kindness to this child, <em>I will come
again</em>.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I promise,” she faltered.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Bah, I want no promise; your white face is truer than a
false tongue. You dare not touch him—we of the Caloes have
soft steps and potent drinks. We know how to wait, but in
the end those who tread on us are stung.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You need not tell me that,” she answered bitterly, struggling
with her terror.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Be cautious then; you who owe this vast property to us
should be considerate!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“To you?—to you?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, to us. Had not Lady Clare drank too freely of
harmless cold water—had not Lord Clare known it, and so
tortured himself to death, where would your chances of property
have been?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And you did this?” cried the woman, aghast.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Who else? The gentiles have no relish for vengeance,
they swallow it at a mouthful—we take a life-time for one
meal—don’t make us hungry again!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Chaleco turned away with a scornful smile, and, stooping to
my ear, whispered,</p>

<p class='c014'>“At Marston Court to-night, I shall wait!”</p>

<p class='c014'>He glided toward the window, lifted the curtain, and was
gone before Lady Clare knew that he had moved; for, overcome
with cowardly terror, she had buried her face in the
cushions of her easy-chair.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>I did not wait for her to look up, but left the room, satisfied
that my poor old benefactor was saved from all attempts at
persecution.</p>

<p class='c014'>I went to the parsonage after this, where I might be another
day—what course of life would be mine was uncertain, all that
I knew was that my life at Greenhurst had ended.</p>

<p class='c014'>Thus tortured in its affections, my poor heart turned with
longing tenderness toward Cora, the only child companion I
had ever known. I would see her, and with my secret kept
close, have the joy of one mere loving interview. My heart
grew gentle with tenderness as I approached the house. She
was not at the window. An air of strange gloom pervaded the
place. I entered the parlor; it had not been swept that day;
books, drawings, and Cora’s guitar lay huddled together on
the table; all the blinds were closed but one, and that was kept
in constant motion by the wind, now letting in gushes of light,
again filling the room with shadows.</p>

<p class='c014'>In a dim corner stood Mr. Clark’s easy-chair with the back
toward me. I approached it and leaned over. There sat the
curate exactly as he had the morning of his wife’s death, pale,
tearless, the most touching picture of grief that I ever saw.</p>

<p class='c014'>I looked around for the cause. Where was Cora, and her
father in this state? I ran to her room; it was empty. Into
the kitchen; the servant sat moping by a dresser. She did not
know what had come over her master, or where Miss Cora was.
He had not spoken a word or eaten a mouthful since she went
out.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sick at heart, I went back to the parlor, and, kneeling by the
good man, took his hand in mine.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Speak to me!” I said; “oh, speak—what has happened?
Why are you thus?”</p>

<p class='c014'>He looked on me as he had done that first day in his grief,
laid his hand on my head, and burst into tears. He did not
speak, but put one hand into his bosom, took out a letter and
attempted to unfold it. But his poor hands shook so nervously
that the paper only rattled in his grasp.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>With painful forebodings I took it from his hand. I did not
read it all, for a sickness of heart came over and blinded me;
but enough was plain; Cora Clark, my little Cora had left her
father’s house to be married—so she wrote—and her companion—who
was he?</p>

<p class='c014'>George Irving left Clare Hall on the very night that letter
was written. She mentioned no names, but this was a part that
all might read.</p>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Clark looked wearily at me as I read the letter. His
lips moved, and he said in a meek, broken-hearted voice,</p>

<p class='c014'>“What can we do, Zana?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“We will find her—love her—take her home again,” I said.
“Cora shall not remain with this villain, even as his wife!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I fear,” said Mr. Clark, looking meekly in my face, “God
has taken away my strength—I cannot follow them.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He arose to his feet, but staggered feebly and fell back again,
helpless as a child.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I will find her. Get well and wait patiently, father, I will
not rest till Cora is at home again.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“God bless you my child!”</p>

<p class='c014'>He kissed me on the forehead, and with this holy seal upon
my brow, I went forth from among my father’s people an outcast,
an Ishmael among women, but strong to act and to endure.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XLVII.<br> <span class='large'>MY LOST FRIEND AND MY LOST HOME.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>I had made all my preparations, packed up a few clothes,
such as I could carry upon the horn of my saddle, and carefully
sealed up the bronze coffer, which was half full of gold. Turner
had been absent most of the day, and Maria, luckily, was at
the village, for some household purpose. All this was fortunate.
Knowing that a few hours would separate us, perhaps forever,
I could not have sustained my part in their presence.</p>

<p class='c014'>When they came home my eyes were red with weeping, and
I sat down helplessly between them, so sick at heart that it
seemed to me like death. They had heard of Cora’s elopement,
and did not wonder at my grief.</p>

<p class='c014'>We parted for the night about ten. Oh, how I yearned to
throw myself once more into those kind arms and ask a last
blessing! But it could not be. A suspicion that I was about
to leave them would have defeated my plans. I knew well that
they would go forth into the highway homeless beggars rather
than see me so depart.</p>

<p class='c014'>With calm sadness, though my heart swelled painfully in my
bosom, I went to my room. Oh, that dull, mournful hour of
solitude while I waited for those two friends, all I had on earth,
to sleep, that I might escape like a thief from beneath their
roof. I shall never forget that hour. A life-time of dreary
pain was crowded into it. Remember I was very young, and
could only recall as a dream the time when that park had not
been my home.</p>

<p class='c014'>True, I had a purpose that gave me strength. Cora must be
brought back to her father; then what was to be my fate?
The gipsy caves of Granada—those caves at whose bare remembrance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>my poor mother had shuddered even in the zenith of her
happiness? But where else should I go? Ishmael was not
more thoroughly cast out by his father’s people than I had been—while
more fortunate than me, his mother went with him into
the desert. I was alone. In the broad world there was no
human being from whom I could claim the draught of cold
water which poor Hagar gave to him.</p>

<p class='c014'>I went forth, braving all the woes that were divided by the
outcast mother and her child. The rival that I had loved better
than a sister had taken the soul that was mine, and cruelly
left me to perish or to suffer; it mattered as little which to her
as it did to Sarah, that her handmaid died in the wilderness, or
passed heartbroken into the desert. Driven forth from my
last shelter by my father’s sister, hunted down like an evil
thing, I felt like the poor stag which I had once saved from the
very foes that seemed chasing me to death. As I sat there
alone in my pretty chamber, with the coffer in my lap, and the
bundle at my feet, I thought of the stone cairn beneath which
my mother lay, deep in the snow mountains, and wished that I
too were under it.</p>

<p class='c014'>Everything was still. Nothing but the faint flutter of autumn
leaves as they fell to the earth reached my ear. Yes, one thing
more, the beatings of my poor heart sounded loud and quick in
the stillness, like the laugh of winter winds when they rustle
through masses of dead foliage.</p>

<p class='c014'>I got up at last—oh, with what heaviness of heart and limb.
With the coffer in one hand, and the bundle in the other, I
passed like a ghost from my beautiful chamber, leaving it bathed
in the autumn moonbeams, all the more quiet that a weary
heart had gone out of it.</p>

<p class='c014'>I went through the little picture gallery. The moonlight
threw my black shadow on the lovely pictures and statuettes,
veiling them, as it were, in mourning at my approach. As I
looked back through my tears, they were poised gracefully as
ever, and smiling in the pale light heartless as my human friends.
It was only in my path that the darkness fell.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>One moment I paused at the door of Turner’s room. I held
my breath, listening at the key-hole for the faintest noise. A
sigh from those loved sleepers would have fallen upon my heart
like a blessing. Nothing reached me—nothing but the sound
of the wind, which was beginning to sob among the leaves out
of doors.</p>

<p class='c014'>As I listened, something rubbed against my ankle, and the
soft purr of a house cat, whose instinct had recognized me in the
dark, made me utter a faint exclamation. I stooped down and
caressed the kind animal a moment, then hurried away, fearful
that my sobs would arouse Turner. The cat followed me to the
stable, and looked on while I saddled Jupiter with a sort
of grave wonder, which seemed to me like regret. She watched
me as I fastened my bundle and mounted the poor old pony.
When I rode away, looking wistfully back at the house, she
kept her place till I could no longer distinguish her.</p>

<p class='c014'>I believe it was a beautiful night; certainly the moon was at
its full, and the sky crowded with stars, luminous with that deep
glow which precedes an early frost. Without being boisterous,
the wind filled the leaves with their mournful whispers, and the
fragrance of broken leaves and forest flowers, that always
breathe sweetest as the frost kills them, floated silently on the
air, saddening the atmosphere with the perfume of their decay.</p>

<p class='c014'>I received all these impressions passively, for my heart was
too heavy for anything but that dull consciousness which is
blunted by pain. All the way I was comparing myself with
the boy Ishmael, and thinking of Hagar with yearning sympathy,
such as a woman only who has been wronged and cast
forth into that great desert the world can feel.</p>

<p class='c014'>I reached Marston Court, but the imposing beauty of those
walls, the picturesque effect which the broad moonlight produced
among its carved balconies, broad eaves, and great entrance
doors, made only a dream-like impression on me. My heart
was full of one thought. Here and now I must part with old
Jupiter for ever, my last friend. I reached the steps, let myself
down from the saddle, and unknotted my bundle with cold,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>trembling fingers, that blundered painfully in their task. Then—it
was because I wanted to prolong the moment of parting—I
knotted up the bridle short upon his neck, that he might not
tread on it. When this was done, I stood a long time with my
arm over his neck, crying like a child. Poor old fellow! when
I stood up and shook his bridle, telling him as well as I could
for my sobs, to go home again, he turned his head and fell to
whimpering, as if he understood my desolation better than any
human creature had done.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Go,” I said, for all the strength was leaving me. “Go
home, Jupiter—home!”</p>

<p class='c014'>He went tramping heavily over the tangled ground homeward
as I had commanded. I stood till he disappeared among the
thickets, listening breathlessly for his last footfall. When that
came, I felt, for the first time, how utterly, utterly I was alone
in the world. I sat upon the steps of that old house a long
time, without thinking or caring what was next to be done.
Perhaps I fell asleep; but at last a hand was laid on my shoulder,
and Chaleco stood beside me.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Come,” he said, “this is no place for you; the night is
cold.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Is it?” I said, rising languidly, “I did not know it!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Not know it? Why you are trembling like a willow
branch now.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I was indeed shivering from head to foot. My garments
rustled as I stood up, for the dew upon them had turned into
frost.</p>

<p class='c014'>Chaleco had kindled a fire in the huge chimney of his tower
room, and the flames sent a thousand shadows dancing among
the grotesque marble carvings that overhung them. He had
evidently made some preparations for my coming. A huge
easy-chair, cushioned with tarnished velvet, stood on the hearth;
and on a little work-table, with curiously twisted legs, was a
plate of biscuit, and one of those old-fashioned goblets of Venetian
glass which have since become so rare.</p>

<p class='c014'>I was about to sit down, somewhat cheered by the warmth;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>but Chaleco prevented this, while he shook the frost from my
garments and carefully removed my bonnet.</p>

<p class='c014'>“There, now, you may warm yourself without being wet
through,” he said, kindly; and taking a silver cup from the
hearth, he filled the goblet with Bordeaux wine, spiced and
warm.</p>

<p class='c014'>“There,” he said, “eat and drink; then we will have some
talk together.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I obeyed him, cheered and comforted, spite of my grief.</p>

<p class='c014'>“There, now that you have got a dash of color, and have
ceased trembling, tell me how you got away. Did any one
attempt to stop you?” said Chaleco, at length.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No one knew—I ran away!”</p>

<p class='c014'>He laughed.</p>

<p class='c014'>“That was right—the old blood there. But Papita’s money—you
did not leave that behind?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, I have it here. Do you want it?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I? by the Sphinxs! no, it would burn my soul. The
gold is yours—everything in the coffer is yours. Papita’s
curse would consume any other who touched it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But what can I do with it?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Chaleco laughed till his white teeth shone again.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What can you do with it?” he said. “Anything, anything.
It will take you to Granada—make a queen of you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I shook my head.</p>

<p class='c014'>“So you reject it; you still despise the Caloes who would
adore you—still cling to the Gentiles who have spurned you
forth like a dog.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Not so—I scorn no one—I cling to no one—God help me!
I have nothing on earth to which I can cling!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Your mother’s people—are they nothing?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“They murdered her!” I said with a shudder.</p>

<p class='c014'>Chaleco turned white; his eyes fell, and he muttered,</p>

<p class='c014'>“I—I did not do it!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, but they did,” I answered.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It was the law—an old law, made among the people of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>Egypt centuries ago; no man among us dares withstand the
law.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But you would have me acknowledge these laws—enforce
them?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Our people are ready; go to them with those blood-red
rubies in your ears; give them of Papita’s gold, and they will
make you greater than Chaleco—greater than Papita ever
was.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Again I recoiled from the thought.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Where else will you go?” asked the gipsy; “who else
will receive you? What other friend have you on earth but
me—me, the man whom your mother betrayed? Yet who has
spent his life in guarding her child. If not with your own people,
where will you go, Zana?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Where could I go? Deserted by the whole world, who
would receive me save the gipsy hordes of my mother’s race, or
those to whom friendship for me would bring ruin on themselves?</p>

<p class='c014'>I did not attempt to answer. On the broad earth that
strange gipsy man was the only human being that would not
turn away in scorn, or become imperilled by defending me.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You will go to Granada, Zana?” he continued, bending
over me with paternal interest. “Had Lord Clare but lived to
sign that will, then, indeed, you might have remained here to
triumph over your mother’s foes. Many of her tribe could
have crossed the sea to render homage to Papita’s great-grandchild—the
inheritance of her gold, and the symbols of her
power. In these old walls, Zana, should your court have been;
these great oaks clothing the uplands should have sheltered a
thousand tents. Oh, Zana, we would have built up a little
kingdom here in the midst of our enemies. Why did you not
have that will signed, Zana? It was for this we brought you
back to England—for this you have been left among her destroyers
so long.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Hush!” I said, shuddering—“hush! I dare not think of
it. Great heavens, were all his estates mine at this moment, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>would give them to forget that death-scene. Thank God, he
did not sign that will!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Bah! it was a bad move—but let that drop. Granada is
still open, and Papita’s gold will do wonders among our people
there!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But they are ignorant, rude, untaught. My poor mother
pined among them, even before Lord Clare came to turn her
discontent into aversion.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But they are capable of learning—they will follow Papita’s
child in all things. She has but to will it, and the young ones
of her tribe can be wise and deeply read as their queen.”</p>

<p class='c014'>This idea filled me with a new life. Yes, I might be the
means of improving this wild race. Perhaps God had permitted
me to be spurned and cast forth like a rabid dog from among
the gentiles, that I might become a benefactor to the Caloes.
Surely they could not deal more treacherously by me than my
father’s people had done. These thoughts were succeeded by
a remembrance of Cora, and they gave way before the great
duty that I had imposed on myself.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Chaleco,” I said, with energy and decision, “there is yet
something for me to do here. I had a friend”——</p>

<p class='c014'>He interrupted me.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I know the parson’s daughter, a little golden-haired, blue-eyed
thing, that will always be a child. You would find her—for
what?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“That she may return to her father—that she may be
saved,” I answered.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Nay, nay, let her go. What has Papita’s child in common
with this traitress? What is there worth loving in one who
could become the victim of a wily boy like that?”</p>

<p class='c014'>I felt the blood rush to my forehead at this scornful mention
of the man I had loved with all the fervor of my mother’s race,
and all the pride of his. But was he not a traitor? How
could I resent it, though the swart gipsy did revile him? But
the anger I dared not form in words broke out in decision of
purpose.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>“Stay with me—help me till I find Cora—till I send an
assurance of her marriage back to that broken-hearted man,
and I will then go with you to Granada.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Heart and soul?” questioned the gipsy.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Heart and soul!” I replied.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You will abandon these people?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“If you insist, I will.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then let us linger.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But where—how?” I questioned. “What course can we
take?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“That which they took—the way to Scotland.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Let us start at once,” I cried, fired with a thousand conflicting
feelings, in which there was jealousy, doubt, and a generous
desire to rescue my friend; but my limbs gave way
beneath all this eagerness, and I fell back gasping for breath.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Not now—you must have rest, poor child,” said the gipsy,
smoothing my hair with his palms.</p>

<p class='c014'>I drew back, recoiling from a repetition of the mysterious
influence which had possessed me the last time I was in that
room.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Do you fear me—me, Chaleco?” he said, with saddened
eyes.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No; but let me act independently—let my brain be clear,
my limbs free—let my own will control me—none other shall!”</p>

<p class='c014'>He smiled quietly, and kept his softened eyes fixed on mine.
I began to struggle against the drowsiness that possessed me;
my eyelashes fell together, and I could muster neither strength
nor wish to open them. A languid repose stole over my limbs—I
did not awake till morning, and then Chaleco stood before
me, holding an antique china cup and saucer in his hand full of
smoking chocolate.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Drink!” he said, raking open the embers; “here are
roasted eggs and bread—they will give you strength.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I took the cup. “When shall we start?” I asked, eager to
commence my search for Cora.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Not till after nightfall,” was the reply; “one day of entire
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>rest you must have. Besides, it will not do for us to travel so
near Greenhurst by daylight.”</p>

<p class='c014'>My heart fell at the thought that no one would trouble
themselves about us—no one except old Turner, and secrecy
was the only kindness I could render him.</p>

<p class='c014'>After I had breakfasted, Chaleco left me, and all day long I
wandered through the vast desolation of that old building, as a
ghost might haunt the vaulted passages of a catacomb.</p>

<p class='c014'>The reaction of all the exciting scenes I had passed through
was upon me, and with dull apathy I strolled through those desolated
chambers, regardless of all that would, in another state of
mind, have filled my brain with the keenest emotions. Everything
was so still in the old house—the sunbeams that came
through the windows were so dulled with accumulated dust
upon the glass, that I seemed gliding through a cloudy twilight
quietly as a shadow, and almost as lifeless. I literally cared
for nothing; my heart beat so sluggishly that I could hardly
feel the life within me. Now I remembered every object in the
old house with perfect distinctness. Then everything ran
together like an incoherent dream.</p>

<p class='c014'>Night came, and then I began to wonder about Chaleco, who
had been absent all day. I had no apprehension, and but little
anxiety; nothing just then seemed important enough for me to
care about. I thought even of my father’s death-bed with a
sort of stolid gloom.</p>

<p class='c014'>Lifted high up among the old trees, and opening both to the
east and west, the turret in which I sat took the last sunbeams
in a perfect deluge, as they broke against the tall windows and
shed their golden warmth all around me. I knew that these
bright flashes came from behind Greenhurst, and that I might
never see it more. This saddened me a little, and a throb of
pain was gathering in my bosom when Chaleco came in. I did
not know him at first, so completely was he changed. The
broad sombrero, the tarnished gold and embroidery of his gipsy
habiliments were all gone. A suit of quiet brown, with knee-buckles
of gold and leggins of drab cloth, such as the better
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>classes of England wore on their journeys at that time, had
quite transfigured him. His coal-black beard was neatly trimmed,
and though his flashing eyes and peculiar features bespoke
foreign blood, no one would have suspected him of being the
picturesque vagrant he had appeared in the morning.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well,” he said, cheerfully, “are you rested and quite ready
to start? I have been making inquiries.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Do you still intend going to Scotland?” I asked. “What
have you found out?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“That they went north—so must we. Here, I have brought
some food—the dusk is gathering—eat and let us be off. Old
Turner tracked your pony across the park in this direction; he
may be for searching the old house, and then all chance of
coming again will be over. I would not have this eagle’s nest
discovered for the world.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But Lady Catherine will discover it,” I said. “She will
not leave the noble building to fall away thus.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I have taken care of that. The door leading to the rooms
below was walled up when I first came to England. You have
not noticed, but the staircase winds down within the walls, and
has a passage outward through the wine vaults. We entered
through a great oak panel which opens from the picture gallery;
close that and no passage can be found to the turret. I have
formed a snug bower here, off and on, ever since you were left
in the tent, Zana.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And were you here then?” I asked, remembering the suffering
of that period.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, I fled. Old Papita’s death and her work at the Hurst
drove me off. I went into Spain for a little time—and then
farther still.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And since then have you been always here?”</p>

<p class='c014'>He laughed in derision at my ignorance.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What, a Caloe count of our tribe, and always in one place?
What a child it is! No, no, I only found a roost up in this
tower now and then, long enough to see how it fared with you
and the enemy. I have been a great traveller, Zana, sometimes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>on your father’s track for months and months—sometimes
hovering over your pretty nest—sometimes with our people in
Granada.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why did you follow Lord Clare?” I inquired, filled with
wonder and respect for energies so indomitable.</p>

<p class='c014'>“That my rights of vengeance should not be lost. I had
received nothing but pangs and shame. The tribe had <em>her</em>.
Papita swooped up Lady Clare—but the greater criminal, the
most hated thing of all, was left to me. No dog ever scented
his prey as I tracked Clarence, Earl of Clare.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What for?” I cried, thrilled with a horrible suspicion.
“Why did you so hound out my father?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why?” he repeated with shut teeth and gleaming eyes.
“What do we follow the trail of a snake when it has bitten
us for, but to kill it?”</p>

<p class='c014'>My heart was seized as with the talons of a vulture, as he
said this. I remembered the subtle poisons so often mentioned
in my mother’s journal, and rapidly connected them with my
father’s terrible appearance when he returned home to die.
Some of these poisons I knew to be of slow action, eating up
vitality from the human system like the sluggish influence of
miasma. Had my noble father been thus poisoned, and by the
man who stood before me?</p>

<p class='c014'>I could not speak—the horrible thought paralyzed me; my
throat was parched; the breath panted and swelled in my
lungs, but I could not draw a deep respiration. Was it indeed
so?—had I sought shelter with my father’s murderer? He
read my thoughts and smiled fiercely.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You are wrong,” he said; “I did not do that, it needed
not the drao, his own thoughts were enough to poison a dozen
lives stronger than his. I watched him night and day—night
and day, Zana; at a distance sometimes, but oftener close as a
brother might, in those safe disguises that our people study so
well. Month after month I was alone with him in the desert—on
the hot sands of Africa—on the sluggish waters of the
Nile. I was his dragoman, his confidential companion; for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>in the desert, Zana, even that haughty being, an English
nobleman, learns something of that equality which he is sure
to find in the grave. Ten thousand times I could have killed
him like a dog, left him in the hot sands for the jackals, and
no one have been the wiser; but that would have been like a
gentile, who, in the greed of his revenge, ends all with a blow.
It was sweeter to see the flesh waste from his bones; the light
from his eyes; and to watch the death-fires kindle in his
cheeks, set to blazing and fed by the venom of his own
thoughts. I tell you, girl, not for the universe would I have
shortened his misery for a moment. To watch it was all the
joy I have tasted since your mother’s last death-wail.”</p>

<p class='c014'>While he spoke, I struggled with the breath driven back
upon my chest as one wrestles with a nightmare. It seemed as
if I was given up to the power of a demon. At last my voice
broke out so sharp and unnatural that it seemed like another
person’s.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Stop, stop, I will not endure this; he was my father—he
was not deserving of this cruel malice, this murderous revenge.
He was my father, man, remember that, and spare me.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is because he was your father that I hated him—that I
gloated over the pangs that ate away his life with a keener
anguish than I could have dealt him,” answered the gipsy,
hissing the words forth as a serpent shoots venom through its
jaws.</p>

<p class='c014'>“My God! my God! is the murderous blood of this man’s
race in my veins?” was the wild response that broke from me
as I writhed in the torture of his words—“must I become a
fiend like this?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Instantly Chaleco seemed transformed; the evil light went
out from his face, leaving that look of subtle cunning almost
universal among Caloes. With sinister gentleness he strove to
soothe me into forgetfulness of all the tiger so late rampant in
his nature.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Come, little one, look up and weep, if you can; this hot
and fiery look never was your mother’s.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>“She had only her own wrongs to suffer and forgive; while
I—oh, Father of mercies, how great is the load of evil that I
inherit and must endure! Am I doomed like Ishmael? Must
my hand be raised against all races and all people? Is there
no brotherhood—no sisterhood—no humanity left for me on
earth?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Hush!” said Chaleco, softly, and gliding to the back of my
chair—“hush, little one, this is madness!”</p>

<p class='c014'>As he spoke, I felt the soft touch of his hands upon my
head. What unearthly power was it that possessed this man?
Scarcely had his palm smoothed down my hair twice, when the
oppression upon my chest was gone. A feeling of ineffable
calm stole over me; the hate which a moment before had
burned in my heart against him, sunk quietly down, as a tiger
falls asleep. I remembered all that had been said of my father,
it is true, but vaguely as one thinks of a dream; the sting and
anguish, the sense of reality was gone. I slept a little, probably
ten minutes, for it was not wholly dark when I awoke, but
it seemed as if that sweet slumber had refreshed me for hours.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Come now,” said the gipsy, bringing my bonnet, and a
habit of dark green cloth that I usually wore in cold weather
when on horseback, “get ready and let us ride. We must
make a good night’s work of it!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“My poor Cora,” I muttered, gathering up the riding-habit,
“when you are found, what will there be for me to accomplish?
What is before me after that?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Hush, Zana—have you no belief in the God you talk about?
We of the Caloes, who expect nothing beyond this earth, fear
nothing while here; but you, this hereafter makes cowards of
you all; you are forever and ever flinging the present—all a
man ever is sure of—after the past, or filling it with fears that
blacken the future. Bah! what is your faith to be counted for,
if it gives no better courage than this?”</p>

<p class='c014'>I felt the rebuke, and without another complaint equipped
myself to depart.</p>

<p class='c014'>I saw no more of the old house that night, for we passed the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>secret panel in the winding staircase which led to the main
building, and penetrating downward through cellars and vaulted
passages, came to the open air through the floor of a dilapidated
summer-house.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Look,” said Chaleco, holding his lantern down that I might
examine the tessellated pattern worked in with colored marbles.
“Should the old house be inhabited at any time, and you wish
to seek the tower yonder, press your hand upon this little flag
of verd-antique, the only block of that noble stone that you
will find here. See how easily it works!”</p>

<p class='c014'>He touched the diagonal fragment, and instantly the centre
of the floor sunk an inch or two and wheeled inward, leaving a
circular entrance and a glimpse of the winding stairs we had
just mounted, where a large mosaic star had a moment before
formed a centre to the radiating pattern of the pavement.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You understand,” he said, wheeling the star back to its
place, “this passage may yet be of use, who knows? At any
rate, it is our secret. I found the passage and blocked up the
turret door. No one remembers much about the old house
now, and the change will never be noticed. No human soul
that ever breathed here, save you and I, are alive; and my lady
countess must take the old pile as she finds it. Twenty years
of ruin will make changes; the birds and I have held possession
a long time,” he added, lifting his eyes to the rooks’ nests that
blackened the topmost boughs of a group of elms just above us.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XLVIII.<br> <span class='large'>OUR FLIGHT FROM MARSTON COURT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>In the shadow of these elm trees two horses were standing,
one equipped for a lady. They tossed their heads as we came
up and backed restively from the light.</p>

<p class='c014'>“They are fresh as larks, you see,” said Chaleco, patting the
near horse with his hand. “So, so, Jerald, is this the way
you stand fire?” and he swung the lantern full in the creature’s
face, which made him rear and plunge backward. “Come,
Zana.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I stepped forward, and with a laugh Chaleco lifted me to the
saddle.</p>

<p class='c014'>“There is the true blood again,” he muttered, smoothing
down my skirt, while I gathered up the bridle.</p>

<p class='c014'>A pair of leathern saddle-bags, such as were often used by
travellers in those times, were swung across Chaleco’s saddle.
They contained, he told me, the clothes I had brought in one
end, and the bronze coffer in the other.</p>

<p class='c014'>While he arranged these saddle-bags, I sat upon my horse
looking gloomily around. It was a dull, cloudy night. The
dense masses of foliage seemed like embankments of ebony.
All around was still and dark as chaos, save the elm-tree
boughs overhead, that began to bend and quake beneath the
disturbed rooks that swept back and forth among them, sending
out their unearthly caws. They seemed like dark spirits calling
out from the blackness, “go, go, go!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Chaleco took the candle from his lantern, extinguished it
beneath his foot, and flinging the lantern away, mounted.
Thus, amid darkness and silence, broken only by the hoarse
rooks that seemed hooting us away, I the only child of Clarence,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>Earl of Clare, left his domain and went forth into the wide,
wide world.</p>

<p class='c014'>We rode fast and steadily on during the whole night, only
pausing once at a field of oats, from which Chaleco gathered
food for our horses. The day revealed a level and very beautiful
country, embowered with hop-fields, and rich with the most
exuberant cultivation. With the bright October air, the sunlight,
and all the strange features of scenery that presented
themselves before me, my spirits began to revive. The warmth
and ardor of youthful curiosity, heightened, doubtless, by the
gipsy fire in my veins, a fire which finds its natural fuel in
adventures, rendered me almost happy. The strange world
on which I gazed, looking so broad, so brave in its morning
beauty, the air at once balmy and bracing, awoke all the
exhilaration of my nature; and nothing but pity for my tired
horse kept me from breaking into a canter along the highway.</p>

<p class='c014'>We stopped at no public house, but ate the cold capon and
bread which Chaleco took from his saddle-bag, at the foot of
an old oak growing out alone on a broad heath or common
which we were crossing at the time. Close by our seat, upon
the little mound of turf lifted up from the level by the gnarled
roots of the oak, a spring of the purest water gushed over a
shelf of rock nearly overlapped by rich moss, and with the
appetites a long ride had given, our breakfast was full of fresh
enjoyment.</p>

<p class='c014'>Chaleco’s wandering habits had fitted him well for this out-door
life. When I asked for drink, he ran down to a thicket
below the spring, gathered some huge leaves, and, while walking
leisurely back, converted them into a drinking-cup with two
or three dexterous turns of the hand. I must have smiled as
the leafy cup was presented, swelling out with the most delicious
water that sparkled in drops all over the outside.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, you smile,” said Chaleco; “this is our free-life, Zana.
In Spain, my girl, your drinking-cups shall be made of orange
leaves, your sherbet cooled with the snows of Sierra Nevada.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>I uttered a faint cry—the leafy cup fell from my hands—the
snow mountains seemed looming all around me. My mother—my
poor mother—how could that man bring you thus to my
mind? Was it hatred of the gentile blood in my veins? Did
he wish to kill me also?</p>

<p class='c014'>We mounted again, and rode on in silence. By his inadvertent
mention of the snow mountains, Chaleco had filled his own
soul with gloom. I began to pity him, for his face grew haggard
with much thought.</p>

<p class='c014'>We rested at noon and slept some hours; then on again
all night, and till dark the second day.</p>

<p class='c014'>Not doubting Chaleco’s ability or sources of intelligence, I
followed him with hope and animation. Perhaps this search
after my friend served to keep my mind from dwelling upon
the future—a future which my soul ever refused to contemplate
steadily; the refinements of life, all the sweet blessings of civilization
are not to be flung aside so readily. Notwithstanding
all the wrongs heaped upon me in that land, I could not think
of the barrancos of Granada without repugnance. There was
something of disgust in this remembrance. A purely savage
people might have aroused my enthusiasm, but this blending
of savage and civilized life found among the Spanish gipsies
destroyed the dignity of both; they had neither the vigor of
savages, nor the refinements of civilization—no religion, no
hereafter. If I went among them, it must be to adopt their
habits, and abide by their laws. But I dared not reflect on
this, and our rapid journeying served to keep such thoughts in
the background.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XLIX.<br> <span class='large'>THE MOUNTAIN LAKE AND HILL-SIDE COTTAGE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>We entered Scotland, travelling rapidly till we reached
the mountains. I do not speak of the scenes through which
we passed, because this memoir is already too long, and my
hands are getting weary of the task. At a little town in the
highlands we found two gipsies that I had seen twice on the
way, evidently waiting for us. After an earnest conversation
with these men, Chaleco came to me, apparently somewhat
elated.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, child, we have found them out at last! Our people
are used to this kind of work, and a few gold-pieces from Papita’s
box kept them on the track.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And have you found them?” I inquired, rejoiced, and yet
with a strange aching pain at the heart, for Cora once found
my promise of joining the Spanish tribes must be redeemed.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Behold,” he said, drawing me to a window of the public
house, which overlooked one of those pretty sheets of water
that lie like mirrors in the rugged frame-work of the Scottish
mountains. “Look yonder on the opposite hill.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I saw a small dwelling perched above the lake, and sheltered
by a vast cedar tree.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well,” I said, “I see nothing but a farm-house, and some
sheep in a hollow of the mountains.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You will find the Gitanilla up yonder, I think,” he answered.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What, Cora—my Cora? Come—come, it is but a walk,
and we are with her.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Better than that,” he answered. “The distance is more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>than it looks; we will be rowed across the lake by our people.
Get your plaid and let us be off.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I went for the Tartan shawl which Chaleco had bought as
we approached the chilly north, and we descended to the lake.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was early in the morning, and long shadows from the mountain
fell sheer across the little loch, letting in gleams of light
only in one or two places where the hills were cleft into fissures
and valleys, their sides rich with heath, through which the sunshine
poured upon the waters in purple and golden splendor.</p>

<p class='c014'>Through these cool shadows and glowing ripples of light our
boat passed to the opposite shore. A footpath led from the
public beach along the side of a valley winding upward with
gradual ascent, to the house we had seen. It was a stone
building, evidently the abode of a sheep-farmer, whose flocks
were scattered over the hill-side, cropping the short grass from
among the heath.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was strange, but this scene seemed familiar to me; the
old stone house, the lake, the opposite mountains, bold and
rugged, the very sheep whitening the hollows, like masses of
snow, reminded me of some foregone impression vivid as the
reality. I bethought myself, with a start, and stood breathless,
gazing upon the house. It was that house, those mountains,
and the quiet lake below that I had seen in my sleep
that night at Marston Court, where, amid storm and lightning,
the history of my parents was pictured in fragments like
that before me.</p>

<p class='c014'>I looked at Chaleco, but he was gazing indifferently around;
evidently the scene had no such associations for him. The
power which he possessed had been sufficient to awaken memory,
not create belief in a thing that had never existed.</p>

<p class='c014'>A mountain vine, whose leaves were red with their autumnal
death sap, clambered up the front of the old house, hanging
around the windows and eaves, like fragments of hostile banners,
in wild keeping with the rugged scenery. Two or three
narrow windows were almost choked up by its red foliage; but
from one, overlooking the lake, it had been forced back in gorgeous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>festoons, revealing a lattice full of diamond-shaped glass,
upon which the sunbeams were shining.</p>

<p class='c014'>As I stood looking at this window, it was gently opened. A
face peered out, and the lattice closed again, before the cry of
surprise and joy had left my lips.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What is it?” said Chaleco, turning sharply at my exclamation.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is <em>she</em>! It is Cora!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, is that all? I expected to find her here.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But she saw me, and shrunk away.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Very likely; but you shall see her, little one, nevertheless.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, why should she avoid me?” I said, twinkling my tears
away with the lashes that could not keep them back.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Come—come—don’t be a baby, Zana; weep when you can
do nothing better,” said the gipsy, out of patience with my
childishness, “wait a moment, and I will send the girl out to
meet you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, no, only ask if I may come in—that is all,” I cried,
breathless with fear that he might be rough with the poor girl,
“tell her that we come from Mr. Clark; tell her anything that
is kind.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He did not hear half I said, but entered the house. Directly
he returned, and beckoned with his hand. I advanced into a
large kitchen, furnished comfortably, but rudely, after the Scottish
fashion, in houses of the kind.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Go in yonder,” said Chaleco, pointing to an inner door,
through which I heard the faint rustle of a dress.</p>

<p class='c014'>I entered a small room, fitted up with some attempt at
elegance. A faded carpet was on the floor, and some old-fashioned
oak furniture stood around. Two or three good
cabinet pictures were on the walls, and some dainty ornaments
of antique and foreign manufacture stood upon a table near the
lattice. By this table stood Cora, stooping wearily forward,
and supporting herself by the window-frame, with her great,
wild eyes, black with excitement, bent upon the entrance. The
long golden waves which ended in ringlets on her shoulders,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>seemed to light up the pallor of her cheeks, and I saw that she
shrunk and trembled at my approach.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Cora!” I said, with a gush of loving joy, “dear, dear
Cora!”</p>

<p class='c014'>She shrunk back, folding her arms, and eyeing me with a
look of affright.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Cora, I came from your father; speak to me, I am so glad
to see <em>you</em>.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But why have you come here? I did not ask it—I did
not want it,” she answered, her eyes filling, and her sweet lips
quivering.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I came to ask—to entreat—oh, Cora, come back, come
back to your poor father, or he will die.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I know it—I know that he will die without me; but how
can I go? what can I do?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Go home,” I answered imperatively; “why, oh, Cora
Clark, why did you leave us?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Don’t ask me—don’t speak to me on this subject; I will
not be questioned,” with a gleam of temper in her blue eyes,
and a willful pout of the lips, the remnants of her wayward
infancy, “you have no right to come here, Zana—none in the
world. Oh, Zana, <em>he</em> will be so angry.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Something of the old love was in her voice. Encouraged by
it, I went and softly encircled her shrinking form in my arms,
leaning my wet cheeks against the golden thickness of her
hair.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Cora, dear, is it your husband that you speak of?” I said,
with a heart that trembled more than my voice.</p>

<p class='c014'>She threw herself on my bosom, clasping me close in her
shaking arms.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, Zana! Zana!”</p>

<p class='c014'>I understood it all, and the heart, but an instant before
trembling with hope, lay heavy and still in my bosom.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Cora,” I said, in a whisper, parting the hair from her forehead,
and kissing it with affection deeper than I had ever
known before, and yet with a shudder, for I knew that <em>his</em> lips
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>had touched that white brow last, and spite of the knowledge,
felt in my soul that he was dear to me even then, traitor and
villain as he was, “Cora, love, come home, the little house is
desolate without you; your father”——</p>

<p class='c014'>“Don’t, oh, don’t; why will you speak that name so cruelly?
I cannot bear it,” she cried, struggling in my arms; “but—but
tell me how he is,” she added, clinging closer and closer, that I
might not look in her face.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Ill, Cora, ill, and pining to death for the sight of his
child.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Her head fell heavily on my shoulder, and she gasped out,
“No, no, he is <em>not</em> ill.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I would not spare her one pang, she must feel all the desolation
that had fallen on her good parent, or my errand would
fail.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, ill, Cora, helpless—stricken down like a child. I left
him in the old chair—that by which you and I stood to comfort
him on the day of your mother’s funeral; that was a
mournful time, Cora, but the day when you left him, think what
it must have been—think of that noble man, calling in anguish
for his living child, and she silent as the dead—gone not into
the sweet peace of the grave, but”——</p>

<p class='c014'>“Hold! oh, Zana, Zana! you are killing me—killing me, I
say!”</p>

<p class='c014'>She broke from my arms, and pushed back the hair from her
face with both hands as she spoke; then, as her eyes met mine,
full of sorrowful reproach and moist with compassion, she let
the hair sweep down, and clasping those two dimpled hands
over her eyes, wept till her sobs filled the room.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Will you leave this bad man and go back to your father,
Cora?” I said, circling her waist with my arms again.</p>

<p class='c014'>“He is not bad—I cannot—I <em>cannot</em> leave him. It is of no
use asking me. It would kill him; oh, Zana, Zana! don’t call
him bad—he is so kind, he loves me so much!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And yet brings you here—steals you away from your innocent
home, to—to”——</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>I could not go on, grief and indignation stifled me.</p>

<p class='c014'>“He does not deserve this—I will not hear it!” she cried,
breaking from me. Her sweet face flushed red and warm
through the tears that streamed over it, and her eyes flashed a
defiant glance into mine. “Say what you will of me, I am
wicked, cruel, worse—worse, if it pleases you to say it; but as
for him, did I not tell you, Zana, that I loved him? I do—I
do better than life, better than my own soul, better than ten
thousand friends like you, than ten thousand fath——oh, my
God, I did not say that—no, no, I dare <em>not</em> say that.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I sat down by the table, shocked and almost in despair. She
crept toward me, and sinking down to the floor, laid her head
upon my lap, exhausted by this outbreak of passion.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Hush, Cora, hush, and let us talk quietly a little,” I said,
after a pause, during which we both cried bitterly together, as
we had often done over our petty sorrows in childhood. “Tell
me, darling—don’t, don’t cry so—tell me why it is that this man
does not make you his wife?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Don’t ask me about that—don’t, don’t—he is afraid of
Lady Clare, he expects everything from her.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I know it—I know it well; but”——</p>

<p class='c014'>She interrupted the bitter speech on my lips.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, she is a terrible woman, Zana, and he fears her so
much; she has got everything that ought to be his, and would
quite crush him if she suspected anything before all is settled
between them.”</p>

<p class='c014'>How beautiful she looked with her pleading eyes, soft with
love and dim with tears—so unconscious, too, of her terrible
position, so confiding—my heart ached for her.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You will go back and tell this to father,” she said, kissing
my hands and folding them to her bosom; “tell him only to
have patience for a little time; cheer him up, Zana, he loves
you so much, almost as much, you know, as he did poor me.
Tell him I am quite comfortable here among the hills; that I
read some, and think of him more than is good for me. Will
you say all this, Zana?”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>“Don’t ask me now, darling—take time, I shall stay here by
the lake a week yet; we will consult and think what is best to
be done. Stop crying, dear, it will do no good”——</p>

<p class='c014'>She interrupted me, with a faint smile.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I know it—if tears would help one, I should be very happy,
for I do think no human being ever shed so many. It is lonesome
here sometimes, Zana.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But you are not alone,” I said, with a gleam of hope; “he
cannot find much amusement here to take him away from you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, <em>he</em> is scarcely ever here. They keep him so constantly
occupied.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Who?” I inquired, surprised.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, the countess and the young lady they call Estelle. Do
you think her handsome, that Estelle? some people do,
but”——</p>

<p class='c014'>I interrupted her, sharply.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Lady Clare—is she in the highlands, then?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, they came up to a hunting-lodge, some miles back in
the mountains, that Lord Clare used to live in years ago; his
death made them all too gloomy for society, and they came
quietly up here.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And does Lady Clare know—that is, does she consent that
you reside so near?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I never asked; he thought it best, and I could not endure
to stay in London alone; but after a little, no one will care if
she does know. When all is settled, you see, papa can come
and live with us at Marston Court.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I shuddered; how cruelly each word went to my heart—they
would live at Marston Court then. A jealous pang shot
through me at the bare idea; and yet if her dream should
prove unreal, how terrible must her fate be. The interview
was becoming painful beyond endurance. I arose, she clung to
me caressingly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You will come again, Zana; I have some things on my
mind that trouble me besides my poor father.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But shall I find you alone?”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>“I am almost always alone,” she replied, sadly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“To-morrow,” I said, “be ready and we will go out on the
lake together, and talk over everything. Would you like that,
Cora?”</p>

<p class='c014'>She smiled, and her soft eyes sparkled through their mistiness;
poor, young thing, she was half unconscious yet of the
misery that lay before her. She kissed me over and over again
as I left, and when our boat was upon the lake, I looked back
and saw her standing in the little casement, framed in, like a
sorrowing cherub, by the crimsoned vines.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER L.<br> <span class='large'>THE ANTIQUE BIBLE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>I spent a most anxious night, my heart racked by a thousand
wild emotions. Need I describe them? Has any human being
the power of conveying to another in words the storm of jealousy,
compassion, rage, and love that filled my bosom? I
know that there is a great want of dignity in acknowledging
that I still loved this man, that I could for an instant think of
him without virtuous detestation; but I am writing of a human
heart as it was, not, perhaps, as it should have been. To me
George Irving seemed two beings. The man I had known,
generous, wise, impetuous, all that my heart acknowledged to
be grand in humanity; and the man I had heard of, treacherous,
full of hypocrisy, and vile in every aspiration. I could not
reconcile these clashing qualities in my mind. To my reason,
George Irving was a depraved, bad man; but my heart
rejected the character, and always turned leniently toward the
first idea it had formed. While I pitied Cora from the bottom
of my soul, and loved her so dearly that no sacrifice would have
been too costly a proof of this devotion, there was jealousy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>in my heart that embittered it all. Alas, it is often much
easier to act right than to feel right.</p>

<p class='c014'>When I went for Cora, the next day, she took me to an
oaken cabinet in her room, and with a sad smile—for all her
pretty smiles had a shade of sadness in them now—asked me
to examine some old books that lay huddled together on the
shelf.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is singular,” she said, “but your name is written in some
of these books, and Zana is a very uncommon name. Would
you like to see how it is used?”</p>

<p class='c014'>She took up a small, antique Bible, and after unclasping the
cover of sandal-wood, on which some sacred story was deeply
engraved, placed it open in my hands. On the fly-leaf was
written, in a clear and very beautiful hand,</p>

<p class='c014'>“Clarence, Earl of Clare, to his wife Aurora.”</p>

<p class='c014'>A date followed this, and lower down on the page was a
register, in the same bold writing, dated at the hamlet, some
months after the presentation lines were written. This was the
register:</p>

<p class='c014'>“Born, June ——, Zana, daughter of Clarence, Earl of
Clare, and Aurora, his wife.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The book fell from my hands; I did not know its entire importance,
or what bearing it might have on my destiny, but my
heart swelled with a flood of gratitude that almost overwhelmed
me. I had no idea of its legal value, but the book seemed to
me of inestimable worth. In it were blended, in terms of honor,
the names of my parents; how it came there I did not ask.</p>

<p class='c014'>Cora stooped down to recover the book, but I seized it first,
exclaiming, amid my sobs,</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is mine—it is mine, Cora! Cora, I bless you—God will
bless you for giving me this great happiness.”</p>

<p class='c014'>We went down to the lake, where Chaleco waited with the
little boat. He looked hard at me, as I came round the tiny
cove, where he lay as if in a cradle, rocking upon the bright
waters as they flowed in and out, forming ripples and ridges of
diamonds among the white pebbles of the beach.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>“What is it, Zana?” he said, springing ashore, as Cora
seated herself in the boat, and interrogating me in a whisper
on the bank. “You look sharp set, like a hawk when it first
sees its prey. What has happened up yonder?”</p>

<p class='c014'>I took the antique little Bible from under my shawl, and
opening it at the blank leaf, pointed out the writing.</p>

<p class='c014'>He read it two or three times over, and then thrust the book
into his bosom. His face was thoughtful at first, but as he
pondered over the writing, muscle by muscle relaxed in his
dark features, and at last they broke forth in a blaze of the
most eloquent triumph; his questions came quick upon each
other, like waves in a cataract.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Where did you get that? Is it all? Who has had possession
so long? Speak, Zana, I must know more.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why, is it so important?” I inquired, excited by his look
and manner.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Important! why, child”——but he checked himself,
inquiring more composedly how I came in possession of the
book.</p>

<p class='c014'>I told him how it had been pointed out by Cora. Without
more questioning, he stepped into the boat, and bade me follow
him.</p>

<p class='c014'>When we were all seated, and the boat was shooting pleasantly
across the lake, Chaleco began, in a quiet, indifferent
manner, to converse with Cora. At first she was shy and
reluctant to answer him, but his manner was so persuasive, his
voice so winning, that it was impossible to resist their charm.
After awhile he glided into the subject of the book, speaking
of its antique binding, of the rare perfume which she might
have noticed in the precious wood, and he went on to explain
that it was used of old in the building of the Tabernacle. All
this interested Cora greatly, and when he began to wonder
how this singular volume could have found its way into the
farmer’s dwelling, she commenced to conjecture and question
about the probabilities with more apparent earnestness than
himself.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>“The old people might perhaps know,” she said. “Now I
think of it, they did tell me of some persons, a gentleman, lady
and little child that lived with them long ago—probably they
left the book; but then, how came Lord Clare’s name in it?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, sure enough,” murmured Chaleco, cautious not to
interrupt her.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Besides, Lady Clare’s name was not Aurora, and he never
would have lived here with that beautiful hunting-seat only five
miles off, you know.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“That is quite true,” acquiesced Chaleco, while I sat still,
listening keenly to every word.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You see,” continued the young girl, quite animated on the
subject, “you see how impossible it is that the writing means
anything; but it is in other books—that is, names are written
in them, Clarence sometimes, sometimes Aurora, now and then,
both names; but, Zana, I have never found that but once.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Chaleco fell into thought, and the oars hung listlessly in his
hands for some minutes. At last he spoke again, but on indifferent
subjects, about the lightness of the air, and the beautiful,
silvery glow that shimmered over the waters. But once in a
while he would quietly revert to the book again, till I became
impressed with its importance to a degree that made me restless
for more information.</p>

<p class='c014'>After sailing around and across the lake for several hours,
we drew up at a little island scarcely half a mile across, that
lay near the centre of the lake, green as a heap of emeralds,
notwithstanding the season was advanced, and embowered by
cedar and larch trees, with the richest and most mossy turf I
ever trod on, carpeting it from shore to shore.</p>

<p class='c014'>Chaleco brought forth a basket of provisions from his boat,
and bade us wander about while he prepared our dinner. We
waited to see him strike fire from two flint stones that he
gathered from the bank, and kindle a quantity of dry sticks
that lay scattered beneath the trees. When he had spitted a
fowl, which, gipsy like, he preferred to cook himself after the
sylvan fashion, we went away, and sat down under a clump of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>larch trees, sadly and in silence, as was natural to persons
whose thoughts turned on a common and most painful subject.</p>

<p class='c014'>I had resolved, there and then, to make my last appeal to the
infatuated child. She must have guessed this from my silence
and the gravity of my face, for she became wordless as myself,
and as I glanced anxiously in her eyes they took the sullen,
obstinate expression of one prepared to resist, and, if driven to
it, defy.</p>

<p class='c014'>We sat down together upon the grass. The delicate green
foliage of the larches quivered softly over us, and the brown
leaves of some trees that had felt the frost, rustled through the
air and spotted the turf as with the patterns in a carpet. We
remained a long time gazing on these leaves, in sad silence, but
holding each other by the hand, as was our habit when little
children. My heart was full of those dear old times; it killed
me to think that they were gone forever—that again on this
earth Cora and I could never be entire friends, friends between
whom no subject is forbidden, no respect lost. When
I thought of this, and knew that, the impediment lay in my
heart as much as it could in her conduct, the future for us both
seemed very hopeless. I can hardly describe the feelings that
actuated me. Perhaps they arose from the evil felt in my own
person, the result of a step like that which Cora had taken,
entailed by my mother. True, the cases were not alike; my
poor gipsy mother had not sinned consciously; no high moral
culture had prepared her to resist temptation; no fond parent
graced her with his love; but her act had plunged me, her
innocent child, into fatal troubles that must haunt me though life.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is possible, I say, that these thoughts prevented me feeling
all the charity that would have been kind for the poor girl at
my side; perhaps, and this is most probable, I could not forgive
the companionship of her error, for it is a terrible trial to
feel that one you cannot entirely respect is preferred to yourself.
In striving thus to analyze the feelings that made me
drop Cora’s hand for a time as we sat silently together, one
thing was certain, I did not cordially love her with the affection
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>of former years. Still, feelings swelled in my heart
stronger and more faithful than love—gratitude, and my solemn
promise to the good father; compassion for her, not
unmixed, but powerful enough to have commanded any sacrifice;
a firm desire to wrest her from the man who had wronged
us both; all these motives influenced and urged me on to rescue
that poor girl, if human eloquence and human will could accomplish
it.</p>

<p class='c014'>I attempted to speak, but my throat was parched and my
faculties all lay dead for the moment; but struggling courageously
with myself, I took her hand, pressing it between my
own cold palms; “Cora,” I said, still in a whisper, for my voice
would not come, “have you thought all this over? will you go
with me to your father? Remember, love, he is ill and may
not live.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The hand began to tremble in mine, but she turned her face
away.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Let the subject drop,” she said, in a voice low and full of
pain, like mine; “it is of no use talking, I will not leave him.
It would kill us both; I should perish on the way.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Now my voice returned—my heart swelled—words of persuasion,
of reason, rose eloquently to my lips. I reasoned, I
entreated, I portrayed the disgrace of her present position,
prophesied the deeper shame and anguish sure to follow. I
described the condition of her father in words that melted my
own heart and flooded my face with tears. I prostrated myself
before her, covering her dimpled and trembling hands with
my tears, but all in vain. My passion was answered with
silence or smothered monosyllables. She suffered greatly; even
in the excitement of my own feelings I was sure of that. At
length she broke from me, and rushed off toward the beach,
evidently determined to protect herself from my importunity
by the presence of Chaleco.</p>

<p class='c014'>I had no heart to follow her, but went away in another direction,
walking rapidly toward the opposite extremity of the
island.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER LI.<br> <span class='large'>THE ISLAND COVE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>As I neared a tiny cove that shot up like a silver arrow into
the green turf, I was surprised to find the gay streamers of a
pleasure boat floating over the rushes that edged the cove.
With my tearful eyes and flushed countenance, I was in no
condition to meet strangers, and turned to retrace my steps,
heart-sick, and at the moment recoiling from the sight of anything
human. Scarcely had I walked twenty paces, when footsteps
followed me, and some one called me by name. I looked
around and saw Mr. Upham coming up from the boat. I
would not appear to fly from this man, though my heart rose
against him in detestation.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Zana,” he said, approaching me more slowly after I paused,
and speaking with forced cheerfulness, “how came you here, of
all places in the world; are you the goddess of this little island—a
fairy? In the name of everything beautiful, explain this
meeting?”</p>

<p class='c014'>I did not at first reply; indeed it was difficult to account for
my presence thus alone on a remote spot never visited perhaps
once a year. Important, as I felt secrecy to be, I could not
speak of Chaleco or explain anything regarding Cora, whose
position, above all things, must be kept from a man so intimate
with the Clares. I attempted to answer in his own light way.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The spirits of air and water do not offer themselves so
readily, sir; I came from the little public house yonder, in a
very common-place boat.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then you are alone?” he questioned, with a quick sparkle
of the eye, that filled me with courage rather than terror.</p>

<p class='c014'>“At present, yes.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>“And how long have you been in Scotland, may I presume
to inquire?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“A very short time.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But you are not all this distance from home alone?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, I have friends with me.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, yes, old Turner, I suppose. And now, sweet Zana, let
me say how happy, how very happy I am to meet you again;
it seems like a dream.”</p>

<p class='c014'>It was impossible that I should not feel the deprecating
humility of his manner; besides, what had I ever received from
this man but kindness? His only fault was that of having
offered love, protection, honorable marriage, when all others of
his race shrunk from me as if I had been a leper. Still there
was aversion in my heart; and I walked on, but not in the
direction of our boat. He followed me.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Can you forgive it, Zana, that I am still true;—that I cannot
cease to love you?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is not a crime to love any one,” I answered, touched by
his earnestness. “I do not scorn, but am grateful for all kindness!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then you will listen to me?—you will yet be mine? I will
protect you, Zana, in the face of all these haughty Clares. I
am now independent.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It cannot be,” I said, firmly, but not with the austere repulsion
of former days. “I shall never love—never marry—my
destiny is fixed.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, Zana,” he said, “why do you repulse me thus? What
have I done to deserve it? Have not all others forsaken you?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Alas! yes!” I said, weeping.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Have they not treated you worse than a Russian serf or
negro slave, while I have always been firm in my devotion, true
as heaven itself in my love? Is this love at such times nothing,
that you cast it so scornfully away?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I do not cast it away scornfully, but am grateful, very
grateful; still it is impossible that I should ever love you, or
become your wife.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>“Tell me why, Zana!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Because I have no power over the affections of my own
heart; they are the only tyrants I cannot overcome,” I said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But give me time; only endure my presence,” he persisted,
seating himself by me so gently that I was almost unconscious
of the act; “these tyrant affections must yield to the power
of love like mine.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I shook my head and made a motion to rise, but he held me
down with a gentle pressure of his hand on my arm.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Can you—can you know, my Zana, for <em>I will</em> call you mine
this once—can you know how much love you are trampling to
death?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I only know that no one feeling in my heart answers to it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And yet, oh, heavens, how I have lavished the first fruits
of my life away upon this one hope! all other women were
as nothing—to me. The proud Estelle, before whom Irving
bends like a slave, and Morton in infatuation, could not win a
thought from a heart too full of you for anything else. And
little Cora, whose beauty and childish grace divided Irving’s
heart with Estelle, was to me vapid and uninteresting, because
my soul had room for but one idol, and that idol Zana!”</p>

<p class='c014'>I grew heart-sick and felt myself turning pale. Was it
true?—could the heart of man be so vile? George Irving the
slave of Estelle, and Cora, my poor Cora!—</p>

<p class='c014'>“You speak of Irving,” I said, in a voice that shook, though
I made great efforts to compose it; “and of Estelle—tell me—tell—where
is that lady?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What! are you ignorant that she is in Scotland, she and
her mother, consoling the countess, and only waiting for the
decencies of mourning to be over, for the wedding?”</p>

<p class='c014'>A faintness seized me. Poor, poor Cora, this would kill her,
it was killing me. Estelle Irving, <em>her</em> husband, the thought was
a pang such as I had never felt before; to Cora I could have
given him up, but Estelle, from my soul I abhorred her.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You are silent, Zana,” said my companion. “You will
reflect on what I have said. Remember it is not the penniless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>tutor who would have divided his crust with you before, who
asks your hand now; I possess expectations—certainties that
even the haughty Estelle would not reject. The Marston Court
living is one of the best in that part of England; I have already
taken orders.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But I thought the Marston Court living was promised to
Mr. Clark, poor Cora’s father,” I exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c014'>“By Lord Clare, yes; but his sister, you know, has her own
ideas, and since that unpleasant affair of the daughter, she
refuses to think of it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, Cora! Cora! what have you done!” I cried, weeping
bitterly; then struck with sharp indignation, I looked up, dashing
the tears aside. “And that lady—that vile, unwomanly
countess—she dares to punish a good old man for the sins of his
child, while she urged <em>him</em>, the traitor, who tempted her to ruin,
into a position which compels him to abandon her.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Of whom do you speak?” he asked, almost in a whisper, so
deeply had my desperate words excited him.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You know—you know!” I said, breaking forth afresh;</p>

<p class='c014'>“why force me to utter that detested name?”</p>

<p class='c014'>He took my hand. I did not withdraw it, for, at the
moment, even his sympathy was welcome. Sighing deeply, he
lifted it to his lips. I arose, determined to leave.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You will not leave me thus without answer, without hope?”
he said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I have but one answer to give, and no hope,” was my firm
reply.</p>

<p class='c014'>He looked at me an instant, growing pale as he gazed.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You love another still, and believe he loves you,” he said,
with a slow curve of the lip.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Hold!” I cried, stung with shame at the remembrance that
I had once confessed this love and gloried in it; “I do not love
another. It is not in my nature to give anything but detestation
to treachery and vice like his.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then spite of your words I <em>will</em> hope,” he cried, seizing my
hand and kissing it.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>Before I could remonstrate he was gone, disappearing down
a grassy hollow that sloped to the little cave where his boat
was lying. As he sprang into the boat, I saw, out upon the
lake, lying sleepily on the water, another shallop in which a
single fisherman sat with a rod in his hand. His face was
toward me, and it seemed that he was gazing upon the spot
where I stood. How long this solitary individual had been
upon the lake I could not conjecture, but my heart told me who
it was; the nearness of his presence held me in a sort of fascination,
and, like one in a dream, I saw the boat glide toward the
shore, and Irving spring out—a moment, and we stood face to
face.</p>

<p class='c014'>We gazed at each other breathlessly. He was much excited,
and looked upon me with an air of impetuous reproach.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is you, then, and here, Zana—I did not believe it—I
would not believe it even now, the whole thing seems false!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You did not expect to find me in this place, I can well
believe,” was the sarcastic reply that sprang to my lips.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No,” he said passionately, “I did not; they told me you
had fled from home in the night; but that you would come
here, and that I should find you thus, the thought would have
seemed sacrilege. Great heavens, is there nothing trustworthy
on earth?”</p>

<p class='c014'>His passion confounded me. By his words one would have
thought me an offender, not him. I did not know how to reply,
his air and speech were so full of accusation. He saw this and
came close to me.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Zana,” he said, in a voice rich with wounded tenderness,
“leave this place; go back to Greenhurst, Turner will receive
you as if this miserable escapade had never been. This is no
shelter for you; these honest old people up yonder are too
good for the cheat practised upon them.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Cheat—I—explain, sir! your language is incomprehensible,”
I cried, breathless with indignation. “If there is imposition,
let him that practises it answer; this air of reproof ill
becomes you, sir!”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>“I may have been too rude, Zana, but the shock, the pain
of finding you here—for I saw all that passed on the island, and
hoping still that distance had deceived me, came to convince
myself.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Convince yourself of what?” I questioned.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Of your unworthiness, Zana.”</p>

<p class='c014'>His voice sunk as he said this, and tears came into his
eyes.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Of my unworthiness?” I said, burning with outraged pride.
“In what one thing have I been proven unworthy?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Are you not here?—have you not fled from your natural
protectors?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And your mother has allowed a doubt on this question to
rest on me, even with you!” I said, calmed by the very force
of my indignation. “Listen; I left home because it was the
only way to save my benefactors from being turned helpless
upon the world by your countess mother. I left secretly,
well knowing that if those good people knew the price I paid
for their tranquillity, they would have begged on the highway
rather than consent to my departure. I had one other friend
in the world, an elderly man of my mother’s people. He is a
safe and wise person, and with him I go to the tribe from
whence my mother fled when the curse of your uncle’s love fell
upon her.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But this is not the way to Spain. The man who has just
left you cannot be that friend,” he answered; “how came you
here with him in the hills of Scotland?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I came to save”——</p>

<p class='c014'>I broke off suddenly, struck with the imprudence of informing
him that my object was to rescue Cora from his power.</p>

<p class='c014'>“To save whom? oh, speak, Zana! let me believe your object
here a worthy one.”</p>

<p class='c014'>This was strange language. Had he not guessed already
that my love for poor Cora Clark had brought me to the highlands?
Such hypocrisy was sublime; I almost found admiration
for it rising in my heart.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>“See,” I cried, pointing out Chaleco, who stood at some
distance on the shore, “yonder is the man with whom I left
Greenhurst, and with whom I leave these hills in less than
twenty-four hours.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He stepped a pace forward, searching Chaleco with his eyes.
The cloud went softly out from his face, and when he turned a
look of confidence had supplanted it.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Zana, is this the truth?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why should I tell you aught but the truth?” I answered.</p>

<p class='c014'>He looked eagerly into my eyes; his own flashed; his face
took the expression of one who forms a sudden decision.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And you leave to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And for Granada?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“For Granada, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“With that man, and no other?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“With no other <em>man</em>,” I answered, laying an emphasis on
the word man; but he did not seem to heed it as I expected.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Zana, one word more—answer from your soul—do you love
me yet?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Outraged and insulted, I drew myself up. “How dare you,
the promised husband of Estelle, the lover of—of”——Passion
stifled me, I could not utter Cora’s name.</p>

<p class='c014'>He seemed surprised.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am not the promised husband of Estelle; I love no woman
living but yourself, Zana.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Me?—can you say that here—here, and not shudder at
the treason?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I can say it anywhere, Zana.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He looked sincere, his voice was sweet as truth, and so like
it that a thrill of exquisite joy stirred my whole system as I
listened.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You believe me, Zana?”</p>

<p class='c014'>I thought of Cora, and could not answer. Had he in truth
ceased to love her? Could villany so deep appear so honest?
He mistook my silence and went on.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>“Forgive me, Zana, if I read my answer in that bright face.
You love me as I love you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I made an effort to contradict him, but the words died in my
throat, and he went on.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is true, Lady Catherine desires me to marry another;
but while you love me I never will. True she would cast me
off and leave me adrift on the world for seeking you as I have
this day; but I love you, Zana; speak but the word, and I will
take you by the hand, lead you to her presence, and proclaim
you my wife.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Not me—not me; there is another whom you must so proclaim.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He did not heed me, but went on impetuously as at first.</p>

<p class='c014'>“My mother may disown me; thank God, she cannot forever
disinherit; we may have struggles; but what then? we have
youth, strength, ability and love to conquer all. Come with
me now, and in ten minutes all the laws under heaven cannot
separate us.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“In ten minutes?” I questioned, thinking of poor Cora with
painful self-abnegation, for never was a heart tortured like
mine; “ah, if ten little minutes can redeem your obligations to
her, why wait? make this other your wife to-day.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Can you counsel this, Zana? Even you desire me to wed
a woman whom I neither love nor respect?”</p>

<p class='c014'>The blood began to burn in my veins. How dare he speak
thus of the poor girl whose sole fault was her fatal affection for
himself? These indignant thoughts sprung to my lips, but as I
was about to utter them, Chaleco came up. Irving saw him,
and addressed me hurriedly once more.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Speak, Zana, before your strange guardian comes. I give
up all—I offer all; speak, and you are my wife.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Never!” I exclaimed, almost fiercely, “never, so help me
heaven, will I marry a man whose honor binds him to another,
and that other”——</p>

<p class='c014'>“Enough!” he exclaimed, wringing my hand hard, and dropping
it; “you never loved me; farewell!”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>He turned away and darted around a neighboring rock.
When Chaleco came up his boat was far out on the lake, and I
sat watching it with the heaviest heart that ever cumbered a
human bosom.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What does this mean? Who was the young man who left
you just now?” said Chaleco, looking after the boat suspiciously,
as he entered.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It was George Irving; he wished to make me his wife”——</p>

<p class='c014'>I could not go on, my voice was choked by sobs.</p>

<p class='c014'>“His wife?” said the gipsy, with a scornful laugh; “so he has
found out the old books, has seen the register, knows the road
to save himself—cunning young fellow!”</p>

<p class='c014'>I looked at Chaleco in astonishment; his hateful laugh
annoyed me terribly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What is the meaning of this, these old books? how could
they affect him or his offer? he knew before that I was Lord
Clare’s child?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But he did not know before that you are Lord Clare’s
heiress, a countess in your own right—one of the richest women
in England?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Are you mad, Chaleco, raving mad?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Almost—but with joy, my Gitanilla. Listen! your mother
was married to Lord Clare. I do not speak of the Alhambra
ceremony, but here, legally by the laws of Scotland, under
which you were born. In this country, a man has but to live
with a woman, acknowledge her as his wife, before witnesses,
and she <em>is</em> a legal wife, her children legal heirs before any court
in Great Britain. We have this proof here, in Lord Clare’s
own writing, in the old people with whom he left your mother.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And how did you know of this law, Chaleco?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Zana, there is not a thing that could affect you which I
have not studied to the centre. Half my life has been given
up that you might prosper; and now, my beautiful countess,
comes our triumph.”</p>

<p class='c014'>With these triumphant words Chaleco went back to his fire
again.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER LII.<br> <span class='large'>THE SHEEP-FARMER AND HIS WIFE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>I left the rock which had sheltered me, and went in search
of Cora, resolved at once to expose the perfidy so cruelly enforced
upon me. I found her sitting drearily beneath the
larches. At my approach she lifted her head with a look of
sullen apprehension, as if she dreaded further importunity. I
was terribly excited, and breathless, and doubtless pale. It was
impossible for me to begin my painful subject with delicacy or
caution.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Cora,” I said, “Cora, I have seen him—he is a wretch—he
is infamous!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Seen him!—seen him! when? where?” she cried, looking
wildly around.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yonder,” said I, almost lifting her from the earth and dragging
her forward to a point from whence the boat could be seen
close by the opposite shore; “yonder he goes; I have been pleading
with him in your behalf. I besought him not to leave you
with this terrible reproach on your name.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, well,” she gasped.</p>

<p class='c014'>“He refused—he spoke of you as a person whom he could
not respect.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No—no! not that! not that!” she almost shrieked, clenching
her hands together.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Worse, Cora, worse—he dared to offer his love to me—his
vile, traitorous love. Before this he has done the same thing;
but now it was more direct, more passionate. He offered to
brave Lady Catherine, and break all ties for my sake, this very
day.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I paused in this headlong speech; my words had turned her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>to marble. She stood thus white and rigid for a moment,
then, like a statue hurled from its support fell prone upon the
earth; her face downward and clutching the turf with both
hands.</p>

<p class='c014'>I shrieked and fell back from her in dismay, startled by the
suddenness of her fall.</p>

<p class='c014'>She remained still, and but for a faint quivering of her fingers
in the grass, I should have believed that she had dropped down
dead.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Cora!” I cried, “Cora, my poor Cora, are you hurt?”</p>

<p class='c014'>I bent down and attempted to lift her from the earth, but
she shrunk from me moaning and shuddering. This repulse
was not enough, I wound my arm around her and covered her
golden hair with my kisses.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Don’t—don’t, your kisses sting me! I would rather have
vipers creeping through my hair!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Wounded by her words, I desisted and drew back. After a
little she moved, and I saw her face. It was pallid and stony;
her eyes were heavy, and a violet tinge lay beneath them. A
look of touching grief impressed that child-like mouth, which
began to quiver as her eyes met mine.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What?—what have I done, Cora?” was my tearful question,
for the anguish in those sweet eyes filled me with unutterable
dismay.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I heard all that you said—all, every word!” she answered,
laying her head helplessly down on the grass again. “Every
word, Zana! You never told me a falsehood in your life, but
I must not believe this; it would kill me here, at your feet.”</p>

<p class='c014'>My heart sunk. She knew how worthless he was now, when
knowledge was despair. We had been rivals before she became
a victim, that she knew also. No wonder she shuddered when
I touched her—no wonder those sweet features were pallid,
and those white fingers sought to work off the agony of her
soul by tearing the senseless turf.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Cora,” I said, full of the most tender compassion, “I have
done you no wrong, and never will. Since the day I was sure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>that you loved him, I have never willingly been in his presence.
Is this no sacrifice, Cora?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then you did love him once?” she said, looking up, as if
surprised. “No wonder, who could help it. But he, Zana,
Zana, it kills me to think of that—he <em>loves you</em>; and I—I, O
my God—my God, what have I done?”</p>

<p class='c014'>She began to cry, and for a time her form was convulsed
with tears. I, too, wept, for the same hand had stricken us
both. When this storm of sorrow had passed, she lay quite
passive and inert upon the grass, a single tear now and then
forcing itself through her thick lashes, and a quiver stirring her
lips as we witness in a grieved child.</p>

<p class='c014'>During some minutes we remained thus, when she arose and
began to arrange her hair, sitting on the ground, but her hands
trembled, and the tresses fell away from them. I sat down by
her and smoothed the heavy masses with my hand. She leaned
toward me, sobbing.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It does not feel like a viper, now, Cora!” I whispered.</p>

<p class='c014'>She threw herself into my arms.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, Zana, Zana, what shall I do? What will become of
me?”</p>

<p class='c014'>I folded her in my arms, and kissed the quivering whiteness
of her forehead, till it became smooth again.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Come with me, love—come to the good father who is pining
to death for a sight of his darling.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, I will go, Zana. I will never see <em>him</em> again—never,
never. Oh, God help me—never!”</p>

<p class='c014'>I could not avoid a throb of selfish joy as she said this; but
grateful and relieved folded her closer in my arms.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Come now,” she said, struggling to her feet; “take me
away. Let him go to the house and find the room empty, perhaps—perhaps
that will make him feel.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She began to weep afresh, and fearing that she would sink to
the earth again, I cast my arm around her. “Let me help
support you, Cora.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>“Yes, yes, for I am a feeble creature, Zana, but stronger in
some points than you think!”</p>

<p class='c014'>We moved on through the larch groves, uttering broken sentences
like these, half tears, half exclamations, till a sudden
curve brought us close to Chaleco. His sylvan meal was ready,
but neither of us could partake a morsel of it. With natural
tact he did not urge us, but observed everything, doubtless making
his own comments. We entered the boat, and without asking
a question the gipsy rowed us toward the opposite shore.</p>

<p class='c014'>We ascended to the house, and conducted Cora at once to
her room. All she asked was darkness and solitude. I had
seen her on the bed, passive and worn out with the storm of
sorrow that had swept over her. Chaleco joined me in the next
room.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Let her sleep if she can,” he said; “you and I must go in
yonder; we have some questions to ask of the old people.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Chaleco took me to the kitchen. An old woman was on the
hearth, spinning flax; and at a back door where the sun lay
warmly, sat a stout old man smoking. I had not seen, or more
probably not observed this couple before, but now they struck
me as familiar, like persons lost sight of from childhood. Chaleco
went out and sat down by the old man, while I drew toward
the woman, and asked some questions regarding her work. She
gave a little start, looked up, and evidently disappointed, began
fumbling in her pocket for a pair of horn spectacles, which were
eagerly placed across her nose.</p>

<p class='c014'>Never did I undergo a perusal of the face like that. It
seemed to me that the grey eyes under those glasses grew keen
and large as they gazed. At length she started up, breaking
the thread from her distaff, and hurried toward the back door
with every appearance of affright.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Guidman—guidman, coom here,” she said, “coom and see
the young gipsy leddy! As God is above all, she is here, body
and soul!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Gang awa, woman, these new fangled barnacles are deceiving
things. Ye dinna see as ye did,” answered the old man,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>deliberately knocking the ashes from his pipe, by tapping the
bowl on his thumb nail.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, then, look for yoursel, guidman,” said the dame, taking
me by the shoulders, and half pushing me toward the door.</p>

<p class='c014'>When the old man’s eyes fell on my person he stood up and
dropped his bonnet.</p>

<p class='c014'>“A weel, a weel!” he exclaimed, “wonders will never cease;
na dout it’s the leddy hersel with hardly a year on her heed
sin she went, years sine, with the bairn in her arms.” Then
turning to Chaleco, he said, “Ye wer speerin about the stranger
leddy; there she stans.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But the lady you speak of would have been older than
this,” said Chaleco.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It’s just the truth,” answered the Scotchman, sinking on
his bench, “seventeen years wad na ha left her sa bonny, whil
mysel an the guid wife ha sunk fra hale, middle-aged folk inta
owld grey carlins—but then wha may the lassie be?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You spoke of a child!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Aye, gude faith, it’s the bairn grown to be what the mither
was. Weel, weel, time maun ha it’s ain—but wha may be the
ladie hersel? A-whow is it sae, an she sa bonny?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You remember her well then?” persisted Chaleco.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mind her, wherefore no what sud gin me forget her, or her
gowden haired guidman, a bonnier pair n’er staid in shoon. It
wad be na easy matter to forget them, I tell ye!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then they were married?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Wha iver cud doubt it, and their bairn born here?” cried
the staunch old man, proudly; “d’ye think we harbor lemans?
There was guid reason why it sud na be clash’d about; na
doot the Earl of Clare was na ane to put shame on an honest
man’s name.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then he told you that he was married to the lady?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Tell me, yes; wha but himself sud tell me?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And you will swear to this?” questioned Chaleco, allowing
none of the eagerness that burned in his eyes to affect his
voice.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>“Swear, d’ye think I wad say at any time in my life what I
wad na swear till?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And the lady—what did you call her name?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Aurora; it’s a strange name, but my lard said it had a fine
meanin, something about the dawn o’ the day.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes—yes, it was a pretty name—but when together how
did they seem? Was he in the habit of calling her his wife?
Did she call him husband?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Aye—aye, baith him an her; she, puir thing, took great
delight i’ the name.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then you knew this man to be Lord Clare? Had you
seen him often before?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Seen him? wha else learned him to shoot o’ the hills and
fish i’ the loch yonder?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And you would know this girl by your memory of her
mother?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Sud I ken the lassie by mother’s look, d’ye speer?—sud I
ken my ain bairn, think ye? The twa are as like as twa pease—the
same blink o’ the ee—hair like the wing o’ the raven—a
step like the mountain deer. Aye—aye, I ken her weel.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I drew near to the old man, impatient to learn more of my
parents, and was about to interrupt him with questions; but
Chaleco promptly repelled me with a motion of the hand, giving
a warning look which I dared not disregard.</p>

<p class='c014'>Too much excited for a passive listener, I left them and entered
Cora’s sitting room. This little chamber had a double
interest to me now. It was doubtless the place of my birth.
The furniture and ornaments so superior to the dwelling itself
had been my mother’s. I stood by the window looking upon
the lake which had filled her vision so many times. Sad
thoughts crowded upon me as I walked to and fro in the room,
determined not to interrupt Chaleco with my impatience, and
yet panting to hear all those old people had to say of my
parents. Directly Chaleco and the old people came in, and once
more the closet containing those precious books was searched.
A few letters from Lord Clare to my mother, were found;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>Chaleco seized them eagerly, and sat down to compare them
with my mother’s journal, which he had never restored to
me.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER LIII.<br> <span class='large'>CHALECO’S TRIUMPH.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>We were in London, Chaleco, Cora and myself. The gipsy
chief sat at a small table reading some pages of manuscript
that had been a little before brought to him. Cora lay upon
the sofa, with one white hand under her still whiter cheek,
gazing with her great mournful eyes upon the dim wall opposite.</p>

<p class='c014'>I was watching Chaleco; the burning fire in his eyes, the
savage curl of triumph that now and then revealed his teeth, as
we sometimes see in a noble-blooded dog, when his temper is
up. This expression deepened and burned as he read on, leaf
after leaf, to the end. He did not then relinquish the paper,
but turned back, referring to passages and comparing them
with others, sometimes remaining whole minutes pondering over
a single line.</p>

<p class='c014'>At last he laid the manuscript down, dashed his hand upon
it with a violence that made the table shake, and turned his
flashing eyes on me.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is so, Zana; it is so!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What is it you have been reading to yourself?” I inquired.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Wait a minute—let me think it all over. Well, this paper
is from the best solicitor known in the London courts. I laid
your case before him, the Bible, some letters that I found
among other books at the old sheep farmer’s, and my own
knowledge.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>“Well,” I said, “what does it all amount to?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Nothing but this, my little Zana, Aurora’s child, the
scouted, insulted, outraged gipsy girl is, beyond all peradventure,
Countess of Clare.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And Lady Catherine?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Is Lady Catherine still, nothing more.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But her son?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh,” replied Chaleco, with a hoarse laugh, “he is the pitiful
dangler to a woman’s apron strings that he ever was.”</p>

<p class='c014'>My blood rose, I could not endure to hear the man I had
loved so deeply thus spoken of.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Hush!” I said, looking at Cora, anxious to save her feelings
rather than my own, “Irving does not deserve this; he is
no idler, whatever you may think.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I had expected to see Cora angry, as I had been, by this
scornful mention of her lover, but she lay perfectly still, unimpressed
and listless, without a flush or a glance to prove the
wounded feelings that were torture to me. This indifference, so
unlike her usual impulsiveness, surprised us both. But for her
paleness and the blue shadows under her great eyes, we could
not have guessed how much she had suffered since our departure
from Scotland. No sick child ever resigned itself more passively
to a mother’s arms than she had yielded herself to us,
and no child ever pined and wasted away as she did. All her
bloom was gone. Cold and delicate as wax was the hue of
her countenance. The azure shadows I have spoken of, and the
veins threading her temples, gave the only tinge of color
visible in a face rosy as the dawn only a few weeks before.</p>

<p class='c014'>She did not seem to hear us, though this was the first time
we had mentioned her lover’s name when she was by. Even
Chaleco seemed to feel compassion for the poor child, and
dropped his voice, drawing closer to me.</p>

<p class='c014'>“She does not heed,” he said, “but still it seems like hurting
her when we speak of that young villain.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then do not speak of him,” I rejoined, sharply; “where is
the necessity?”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>“But we must speak of them—they have possession of your
rights.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What are those rights?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“A title—an immense property—power in this proud country—power
to help the poor Caloes,” he answered with enthusiasm—“the
power to redeem your mother’s name among the
haughty souls that reviled her—to give back her memory to
the gipsies of Granada pure as the purest among their
women.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But they murdered her—innocent as she was, they murdered
her!” I cried, shuddering and cold with memories that
always froze me to the heart.</p>

<p class='c014'>A gloomy look stole over Chaleco’s face; his hand fell
loosely down, and he whispered huskily, as if to convince
himself:</p>

<p class='c014'>“I could not help it; she gave herself up. They all thought
the stain of his unmarried lips was on her forehead. She
would die—it was <em>he</em> that killed her, not the gipsies—never say
it again while you live, Zana, never.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I could not answer, but felt myself turning white and
cold. He saw it, and grasped my hand, crying out with fierce
exultation:</p>

<p class='c014'>“But she is avenged, and now that we have the power, this
proud woman and vile boy shall bite the dust, Zana. We will
strip them, humble them, trample them beneath our gipsy feet.
Aurora shall be twice avenged.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Let me think,” I said, drearily pressing my forehead to still
the pain there; “I have tasted this revenge once, and it was
terrible; when such fruit falls, dare we shake the vine
again?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Again and again,” was the fierce cry, “till power itself
fails. Are you thinking of mercy, child?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am thinking of many things,” was my vague answer;
“but God will help me.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Chaleco sneered.</p>

<p class='c014'>“He has helped us, if you choose to fancy it,” he said;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>“are not her enemies in the dust—have you not revenge in
your grasp?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No,” I said, filled with the holy spirit my soul had invoked,
“no, Chaleco, God gives revenge to no human being; it
belongs to him. The memory of my dead father is before me—never
again will I wrestle with these weak, human hands for
power which belongs to omnipotence alone.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Chaleco looked at me sternly; a dark frown was in his eyes.</p>

<p class='c014'>“If I thought this,” he exclaimed, grasping the paper as if
about to rend it.</p>

<p class='c014'>He stopped, and held the paper motionless between his
hands. Cora had risen from the sofa, and was leaning forward,
looking at us.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You learned that of my father, Zana,” she said, while a
tender smile stole over her lips; “if anything troubles you, go
back to him; I will.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I was touched to the heart by the pathos and sweetness of
these words. My soul yearned towards the suffering child, and
that instant the resolve which had been floating mistily through
my brain took form and shape. If the disputed estates proved
to be mine, I would so endow that gentle girl, that Irving
would rejoice in the chance of redeeming his prosperity by a marriage
with her. Her fame at least I might partially restore.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You are right, my Cora; I did learn all that is good in me
from that noble-hearted man. You and I should never have
left his side.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I know it,” she answered, sighing heavily, and sinking back
to the sofa again; “you can go back, as for me”——</p>

<p class='c014'>Cora broke off and began to weep. I was glad of that, poor
thing. Since the first day she had not wept in my presence
after our adventure in the Highlands. I left her unmolested,
and went on talking with Chaleco more connectedly than we
had yet conversed. In a little time he convinced me that my
birth was legitimate, and my claims as heiress to Lord Clare
would scarcely admit of dispute. The chain of evidence was
complete. Though driven away for a little time, Chaleco had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>hovered around Greenhurst, till assured that I had found a
protector, then he lingered in England under various disguises,
till I was safe under the roof from which my mother had fled.
More than once he had penetrated to my sick chamber, where
I lay delirious with fever, when I was by chance left alone, or
when the nurse slept at night. Again and again he had visited
England after that, assuring himself still of my welfare and
identity. In short, from the time of my mother’s death he had
never lost sight of me, and up to that period the evidence of
old Turner, his wife, and the Scotch farmer, left no thread
wanting in the tissue of my claim.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And if this is so, what steps must be taken?” I inquired.</p>

<p class='c014'>“They are taken,” answered the gipsy, “Lady Catherine has
been notified, so has her son.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, have they returned any reply?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“The lady is here.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“In London?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, in London.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Did the mother come alone?” I inquired, observing that
Cora had risen to her elbow, and was eagerly regarding us.</p>

<p class='c014'>Feeling that, like myself, she was anxious to know if Irving
was in town and was with the family, I asked the question, half
in kindness to her, half to still my own craving desire for
knowledge on this point.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Lady Catherine, her son, and Mr. Morton came together.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Cora uttered a faint cry, and starting up began to pace the
room, as if the mention of that name had stung her energies
into painful activity.</p>

<p class='c014'>Still I was not fully answered.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And is no other lady with them?” I persisted.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And what if there is, how should you care?” was the
answer he gave, accompanied by a look so penetrating that I
shrunk from it.</p>

<p class='c014'>Cora also turned and gazed at me with her great, tearful eyes,
as a gazelle might look at the hunter that had chased him down.
I felt the whole force of that appealing look, but went on asking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>questions, determined to comprehend everything, and then
act as my own soul should teach.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And did they decide on anything?” I inquired.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The mother wishes to contest—the son advises her to yield;
their friends, as usual, are on both sides.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And so nothing is settled?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Nothing.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I will go to them myself; rest of good cheer, Cora, you
shall not always be so miserable.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She gave me a wild glance.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Be tranquil, and trust me, Cora,” I said, full of my project
for her happiness; “it is for you this good fortune has come.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“There is no good fortune for me on earth,” cried the poor
girl, clasping her hands, “don’t, Zana, don’t smile so; it will
set me to hoping impossible things.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Nothing is impossible,” I said, smothering the selfish
regrets that would, spite of my efforts, rise against the sacrifice
I meditated. “To the strong heart there can be no impossibility—here
there <em>shall</em> be none.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Cora came close to me, smiling so mournfully and shaking her
head, as I can fancy Ophelia to have done, with a world of
sorrow and one little glow of hope in her poor face.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Perhaps he thought that I was within hearing, and so did
all that to tease me.”</p>

<p class='c014'>As this soft whisper dropped from her lips, the determination
of self-sacrifice grew strong within me. Had we stood at the
altar, I think, at the moment, I should have given Irving up to
her; she was so trustful and helpless. I seized upon the idea;
better far was it that she should fancy anything rather than
believe in his faithlessness after all that I intended for her.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It was all unfeeling pleasantry, I dare say; careless flirtations,
that meant nothing.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Do you really think so?” she inquired, stealing closer and
closer to my side.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I do indeed think that he has no real love for any one but
you, Cora.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>“In truth?—in solemn truth, Zana?—oh, Zana, Zana, say
that <em>you</em> cannot believe it again.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I do not believe in his love for—for that other person,” I
said, shrinking from the utterance of Estelle’s name.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Solemnly, you think this, Zana?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Solemnly.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She drew a deep breath, looked at me so long that I could
watch the joy as it broke and deepened in her violet eyes, and
then, satisfied that I was sincere, sunk back to the sofa, with
the most heavenly smile I ever saw beaming over her face. I
sat down by her; she wove her arms around me and pressed
her cheek to mine, trembling softly with that exquisite happiness
which follows a crushed suspicion against those we love.
I could not resist a pang of jealous envy, for it is much easier
to make sacrifices to one that suffers, than to witness the joy
which our self-bereavement gives. The contrast between the
rich swell of happiness that broke in sighs from her lips, and
the heavy sense of desolation that lay upon my poor heart,
made me long to put her away.</p>

<p class='c014'>But soon I felt her kisses wandering amid my hair and over
my forehead, mingled with whispers of gratitude and smiles of
hope. After all, Cora loved me, and I was making her happy.
Most solemnly did I believe all that I had said of Irving. That
he did not love Estelle I was certain; that self-interest had
induced his professions to me I was equally convinced, for
Chaleco’s words had fastened upon me when he said that Irving
had sought me because he knew of the evidence I had
obtained regarding my own legitimacy; and Cora, when I
asked if she had mentioned the register which she found to
any one beside myself, answered, “only to him;” but the tutor,
Mr. Upham, had read them long ago, when he lodged a
season at the hill-side cottage.</p>

<p class='c014'>Cora had told me this on the day we left the Highlands, and
from that time I looked upon Irving’s pursuit of myself as a
mercenary effort to retrieve his own desperate fortunes by a
marriage with his uncle’s heiress. Mr. Upham, too; his interested
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>pursuit was now fully explained; but for him I had scarcely
time for a contemptuous thought, so resolute had my heart become
on the sacrifice of its last hope. With these impressions,
I could not believe that Cora had any rival in his heart,
whatever his interests might dictate. So I soothed her, and
strengthened the confidence that was bringing the roses back
to her cheek, even then. Poor thing, she trusted me so
implicitly, and her weary heart was so glad of rest after its
anguish, that she believed like a child.</p>

<p class='c014'>That night, I wrote to Mr. Clark, saying that his child was
found, and that she trusted very soon to tell him her love in the
dear parsonage.</p>

<p class='c014'>With regard to him, also, I had my benevolent dreams.
There was the Marston Court living. If Lady Catherine had
no right to the estate, her power to appoint an incumbent to
the living did not exist, but was mine; and dear Mr. Clark, God
bless him, how my heart swelled at the thought of rescuing
him from his present dependence, by appointing him rector
instead of the man whose character had degraded the holy
office! I went into no details, but wrote a cheerful letter, full
of hope, determined to wait for the unfolding of events before
I explained everything.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER LIV.<br> <span class='large'>IRVING AND HIS MOTHER.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>I knew that the Clares had a town house in Picadilly, and
quietly stealing out in the morning, when Chaleco was out,
I called a hackney coach and drove there at once. A ponderous
man, in mourning livery, opened the door, and looked well
disposed to order me down the steps when he saw my humble
equipage. But there was a native haughtiness in me that men
<span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>of his class are sure to recognize, and though new to the world,
I was neither timid nor awkward; besides assumption of any
kind was certain to arouse all the contempt and resistance of
my fiery nature.</p>

<p class='c014'>I inquired for Lady Clare.</p>

<p class='c014'>“She was in, and at breakfast; would I call again?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No; I must see the lady then.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“An appointment?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No; but still my interview with this lady must be at once.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“He did not think she would admit me, her ladyship and
Mr. Irving had been closeted with their solicitors all the morning.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You will send up my name and inquire,” I said weary with
his objections, and conscious that this was my time to speak
with Lady Catherine when fresh from her consultation with
the lawyers.</p>

<p class='c014'>My imperious manner impressed him; he inquired my name.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Zana.”</p>

<p class='c014'>His round eyes opened with astonishment. “Miss Zana, is
it?” he said, after a moment of puzzled thought.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Zana, that is all.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He beckoned a footman, and whispered with him. The man
disappeared up some mysterious staircase in the back part of
the hall. The porter returned, and seated himself in his great
gothic chair, took a position, and began to eye me as stage
kings sometimes survey the suppliants that come before them.</p>

<p class='c014'>The footman came back, walking quickly, and with noiseless
step, as well-bred servants usually do in England. Her ladyship
would be happy to receive the young person.</p>

<p class='c014'>I followed him in silence. Would her son be there? This
thought made my limbs tremble, but I think no visible agitation
marked my demeanor or my countenance.</p>

<p class='c014'>Lady Catherine was in her dressing-room, with a small
breakfast-table before her, covered with Sèvres china and glittering
silver. The delicate breakfast seemed yet untasted, save
that one of the cups was stained with a little chocolate.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>Lady Catherine arose, and though she did not come forward,
stood up to receive me. It might have been the light which
fell through curtains of pale, blue silk, but she certainly looked
unusually white and haggard. I saw her thin hand clutch
itself among the folds of her mourning gown, and her eyes
wavered as they met mine.</p>

<p class='c014'>There was an awkward silence as I advanced toward the
table. I think she was struggling to speak calmly, for her
voice was unnatural when she did address me.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Be seated,” she said falling back to her lounge, not with
her usual languid ease, but abruptly, as if in need of support,
“be seated, I—I am happy to receive you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I sat down, firm and composed. He was absent, and as for
that woman, there was nothing in her to discompose me. We
seldom tremble where we do not respect.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Your ladyship probably knows upon what subject I came,”
were my first quiet words.</p>

<p class='c014'>I saw by the motion of her whole body that she could with
difficulty restrain her rage.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, and I thank you for saving me another interview with
your very singular friend,” she said, with a smile that was
intended to be playful, but faded to a sneer.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What, madam, has Count Chaleco been with you?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“If you mean that dark browed man who calls himself your
protector, he has given us the honor of his company more
than once.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I do mean him, and he is my protector!” I answered,
stung by her look and tone rather than by a comprehension of
her words.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Of course. No one would think otherwise. After eloping
with him in the night from Greenhurst, visiting the Highlands,
and domesticating yourselves together in London, there can be,
I fancy, little doubt left on that point!”</p>

<p class='c014'>I began to comprehend her meaning. Isolated as I had been
from the world, and independent of its usages, I could not mistake
the sneering expression of that evil face, had the words
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>failed to enlighten me. But I was not angry. Scorn of the very
thought that she applied these vile imaginings to me curved my
lips with a smile. I could not have forced myself into a word
of explanation or defence. The woman seemed to me only a
little more repulsive than before.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then, madam, if my friend has preceded me I shall have
little to explain, and our interview will be more brief. You
comprehend, doubtless, that evidence of Lord Clare’s residence
with my mother in Scotland, which constitutes a legal marriage,
is in our possession; that the best counsel consider me, and not
your ladyship, the inheritor of his title and estates. Indeed, the
record of my birth, in his own handwriting, where my mother
is mentioned as his wife, is by the laws of Scotland a marriage
in itself.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, all these things have been repeated to me; but the
opinion of lawyers, fortunately, is not exactly the decision of
legal tribunals.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then you are determined to contest my claims?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am not disposed to yield mine without contest, certainly.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Madam,” I commenced; and now every nerve in my body
began to tremble, for the great moment of my fate had arrived—“madam,
in this contest, if it becomes one in an English
court of law, the life and reputation of your only brother must
be cruelly brought before the world; would you make no sacrifice
to avoid that?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But if this same brother was your father also, it is for
you, not me, to save his name from the scandal of a public
court,” she rejoined, sharply. “The fact that he married Lady
Jane while your mother was alive, I would willingly conceal.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, madam, that you mistake. My mother died months
before Lord Clare’s marriage?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“How and when did she die?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“The how does not concern your ladyship. As for the when,
I was present when she died near the City of Granada, and
though a child at the time, can never forget it; would to God
it were possible. After that—months after it must have been,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>for we had travelled from Spain between the two events—I
saw the cortége pass the tent where I lay, returning from
my father’s marriage with his last wife. In this he committed
no legal fault—and let us hope intended no moral wrong—though
a deep wrong it was, from beginning to end; but he
doubtless was unmindful of the singular law which made his
first marriage binding.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then what is there to conceal? Why should we shrink
from investigation?” she cried.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The wrong done to my poor mother, alas! that remains,
and I would do anything, give up anything rather than have it
heaped upon my father’s memory.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And what were these mighty wrongs, if—as you are trying
to prove—he ever acknowledged her, a dancing gipsy beggar,
a”——</p>

<p class='c014'>“Hush!” said I, with a power that must have been imperative,
“you shall not malign my mother.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well,” she answered, waving her hand scornfully, “you
are right. Her history cannot be publicly coupled with that
of our house without leaving infamy upon a noble name.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Not <em>her</em> infamy, madam!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“This is useless and impertinent, miss,” she cried, starting
up fiercely; “you came for some purpose. What is it?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I came, if possible, to save the scandal of a law suit regarding
the Clare earldom and estates. I would shield my father’s
memory, and redress the wrongs of one whose fate is dearer
than my own, at any sacrifice.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And how is this to be done unless you yield at once these
preposterous claims?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Madam, your son!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, what of him?” she cried sharply, and with gleaming
eyes.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The succession will be his when, when”——</p>

<p class='c014'>“When I am gone, you wish to say, but that is a frail hope.
I married when a child, and the difference between Irving and
myself is so little.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>This vanity would have seemed out of character to one so
full of haughty malice as the woman before me; but extreme
vanity is more frequently found connected with bad qualities
that with good ones, so it did not surprise me.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But with your son some compromise may be effected. You
would doubtless rather surrender the unentailed estates to him,
than to one so hateful to your ladyship as I am?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“That may be readily supposed?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, madam, to one or the other you must resign them;
to me if you persist in useless and wicked resistance; to him,
if—if”——</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, if what?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“If by marriage with the person whom I shall select, he
secures the rights which I claim to himself.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“That is, if my son, like his uncle, will degrade himself with
a gipsy stroller,” she replied, with insulting bitterness.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Madam, this is base; that which I propose saves your son
from degradation, does not impose it. It was not of myself I
spoke!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Of whom, then? Is there another claimant?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No. As the legitimate and only daughter of Lord Clare,
who died without will, I have the sole right to all that was his.
You know that the courts will confirm this right, or I had
never been thus admitted to your presence. Your eye wavers;
your lips curve in terror rather than scorn. In your soul you
feel that to hold possession of this house for a day is rank usurpation;
your lawyers have told you all this before.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“How did you learn that?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“From your face, madam—from the fact that you do not
spurn me from your presence as of old.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She smiled, not scornfully, her blue lips seemed to have lost
all strength for so strong an expression, but with a sort of
baffled spite.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And so you would take the estates and attach my son as
an appendage—this is kind!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Madam, I will resign all right to these estates and title on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>the marriage day of your son—not with me, the hated gipsy,
but with Cora Clark, whom he loves, and who loves him.
Greenhurst and the title to rest with you as if I had never
existed—all the unentailed property to be divided between
your son and Mr. Morton, whose rights we cannot honestly
waive.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Her eyes opened wide with astonishment. She fell back on
her sofa, and folded a hand over them, as if ashamed of appearing
startled by what I had said. At last she sat upright again
and looked at me searchingly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You will do this?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I will!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why?—your motives?”</p>

<p class='c014'>The tears started. I felt them crowding to my eyes.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I wish to see them happy.”</p>

<p class='c014'>My voice faltered; but for her presence the agony at my
heart would have burst forth in a wail.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And that will make you happy?” she said, with an icy
sneer. “You will remain and witness the joy your abnegation
gives.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Never!” I cried, yielding to the anguish that was oppressing
me. “I will go among my mother’s people—go”—I
thought in my innermost heart—“go to the barrancas of
Granada, to die of anguish as she did by violence.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And you will leave this country forever?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Madam, I will.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But this girl, this Cora Clark, where is she now? Mr.
Upham, the new rector, sent down orders that her father
should be removed from the parsonage—where has he gone?
How are you sure that Irving cares for her, or would take her
at any price?”</p>

<p class='c014'>I shrank from exposing my poor friend’s weakness to the
knowledge of that heartless woman; she seemed ignorant of
her son’s perfidy, and its results in giving Cora to my protection.
I rejoiced at this, and guarded the secret of their mutual
fault as if it had been my own life.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>“I am certain of it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But you are not of age to make a resignation of these
fancied claims legal, even should I consent to unite my son to
this nameless girl.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am of age to resist all action, and have a will strong as
any law. If I am silent regarding my claims, who will or can
urge them?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But we have only your word!” she said, softening in her
tone, and interrupting her questions with intervals of thought.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But in your heart you know that to be enough. Strive as
you will, my truth will make itself believed.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She waved her hand, rising.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Stay here, I will speak with my son. Perhaps you have
not breakfasted; ring and the man will provide fresh chocolate.
After all, this is a strange offer.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER LV.<br> <span class='large'>SELF-ABNEGATION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Lady Catherine went out, and I was alone, trembling, helpless,
filled with desolation—the poor, poor gipsy girl. What
had Cora done that she should be made so happy, and I so
miserable? I sat down stupefied with the blank darkness that
had fallen around my existence. The estate, the pomp, the
rank that I had given up were nothing; but Irving—oh, how
my poor heart quivered and shrunk from the thought that he
was another’s forever and ever. In all the wide world, that
desolate barranca in Granada seemed the only spot gloomy
enough to conceal misery like mine!</p>

<p class='c014'>A full hour I remained with my elbow upon the little breakfast-table
seated among the cushions, unmindful of their luxurious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>softness as if they had been so many rocks heaped near
me. I could only feel dumbly that with my own hand I had
cast all hope from me. This thought revolved itself over and
over in my mind, I could neither change nor shake it off.</p>

<p class='c014'>At last the door opened and Lady Catherine came in, followed
by her son. He was greatly changed. All the bloom
of boyhood had settled into a look of thoughtful manliness; his
eyes, almost sad, were deeper and more piercing; his manner,
grave; traces of anxiety lingered about his eyes and mouth,
making one firm and leaving shadows beneath the other. He
came close to me and rested one hand on the table. I did not
rise, but sat trembling and helpless beneath the reproachful
pride in his glance. The apathy had left me; my heart
swelled with the painful joy of his presence, and every nerve
thrilled back its sympathy.</p>

<p class='c014'>“My mother has told me of your proposal, Zana,” he said,
in a clear, but not untroubled voice; “your wish is a generous
one. The rights you would surrender are great, but I will not
accede to this proposal.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I started so violently that one of the Sèvres cups fell to the
ground. A cry almost broke from my lips. This reprieve
from my own wishes filled me with joy.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why, why?” I could not ask these questions aloud; they
fell from my lips in broken whispers.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Because I will not despoil you of your birthright—because
I do not love the lady whom you propose for my wife.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Not love her, Mr. Irving; forbear!”</p>

<p class='c014'>I could not go on; his mother’s presence checked me; but
once more my heart was filled with indignation at his audacity.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then you refuse?” I said, rising—“you refuse to render
this poor justice to one who loves, who has”——</p>

<p class='c014'>Again I checked myself. Lady Catherine was close to the
table. Irving listened patiently, and kept his eyes fastened on
my face, as if asking some further explanation.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is possible,” I said, “that you think lightly of my claims,
and thus reject the sacrifice I would make.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>“No,” he said, “I am satisfied that your claims to the
estate are valid; only this morning I joined my mother’s legal
counsel in advising her to yield possession at once.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And this inheritance? Cora, too? Will you cast them
both aside because it is Zana who offers them?”</p>

<p class='c014'>He shook his head with a grave smile.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The inheritance I can easily relinquish; it is not large
enough to purchase a heart like mine, Zana.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“George, George, reflect,” said Lady Catherine, who had
been listening with keen anxiety; “the girl is beautiful; her
mother’s family had noble blood in it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mother, hush; I will work, but not sell myself for your
benefit.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I arose, shocked by the deep hypocrisy of the man. His
look, his voice, his words, how noble they were! His actions—the
household traitor—how could he compel that face to look
so firm and noble in its sin?</p>

<p class='c014'>“Madam,” I said, turning to the mother, “persuade your
son, for on no other terms can my father’s estate remain with
you or yours.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She bent her head, but did not speak. The woman seemed
subdued; all her sarcastic spirit had left her. At last she laid
her hand on Irving’s arm.</p>

<p class='c014'>“George, George, remember there is no other way.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He turned upon her, smiling.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mother, we lived honorably and well before my uncle’s
death; the same means are still left to us.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But the title, the estates, I cannot give them up. Will
you make no sacrifice to save me from this degradation?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Anything, mother, that an honorable man should; but to
barter myself, no.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I saw that Lady Catherine was becoming angry, and spoke,</p>

<p class='c014'>“Madam, when I resign the inheritance, your son knows the
terms. Take counsel—take time for thought. To-morrow, at
this hour, I will come again, alone as now; that will be our
last interview.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>My words struck home. Lady Catherine turned white as
death, and by the glitter in her eyes I saw a storm of rage mustering;
I did not remain to witness it. Irving held open the
door for me. Our eyes met as I passed out, and his seemed full
of reproachful sorrow. Why could I not hate that man?—why
not hurl back scorn for treachery?</p>

<p class='c014'>Cora was asleep when I entered the little room which we
occupied together. It was the sweetest slumber I ever witnessed—so
calm, so full of infinite quietude. Worn out by the
harassing sorrows of her situation, she had, up to the evening
previous, been wakeful night and day, but the few words I had
so rashly uttered fell like dew upon her eyelids, and all night
long she had slept by my side tranquil as a bird in its nest; in
her hopeful serenity she had dropped away in dreams. Thus I
found her with a smile upon her lips, and a soft bloom warming
the cheeks that twelve hours before had been so pale.</p>

<p class='c014'>My own words had done all this, and they were all a deception.
I had deceived myself, and worse, worse a thousand
times, had misled her also. How could I tell her this?—how
break up the exquisite calm of that repose with my evil tidings,
for evil I now felt them to be?</p>

<p class='c014'>The sunlight fell through a half-closed shutter, kindling up
the golden tresses of her hair, as they fell over the arm folded
under her cheek, and lay in masses on the crimson cushion of
the sofa. I sat down by her, watching those sun gleams as
they rose brighter and brighter toward her forehead. They
fell at last upon her eyelids, which began to quiver; the dark
brown lashes separated, and with a sleepy murmur the girl
awoke.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, you have come,” she said, flinging her arms around my
neck; “dear, dear Zana, I have been dreaming.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Dream on!” I answered, sadly; “if I only had the power
to dream also!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why, what is the matter, Zana, your eyes are full of
tears?” she cried, looking eagerly in my face, and kissing it
with passionate devotion. “Where have you been?”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>“I have been to see him, Cora.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She held her breath, and looked at me—oh, how pleadingly—as
if I could change the color of her fate, poor child.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, Zana.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I could not endure that voice, those eyes, but flung my arms
around her, and held her close to my bosom as I answered—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Forget him, Cora. Let us both forget him. He is an
ingrate, a”——</p>

<p class='c014'>I could not go on, for her cold lips were pressed wildly to
mine, and she called out—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Don’t, don’t, Zana—don’t speak such words of him!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“He does not deserve this interposition, Cora; you cannot
guess how much I was ready to sacrifice that you and he might
be happy.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And he would not listen?” she asked, falling sadly back
from my arms. “Still you thought he loved me, and were so
certain of it only last night.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But I think it no longer. God help you, my poor Cora—with
all this inheritance—and I offered it—I have no power to
make him feel.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And you tried to bribe him into loving me; that was
unkind, Zana.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, Cora; other reasons which you do not comprehend
influenced what I did, as well as a wish to make you happy.
His mother, I think, would have yielded, but he”——</p>

<p class='c014'>“His mother, Zana—he has no mother.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“In one sense, perhaps not; but Lady Catherine”——</p>

<p class='c014'>“Lady Catherine.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, Lady Catherine, is she not George Irving’s mother?”
I cried, surprised by her bewildered look and words.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, surely; but then what is George Irving to me, or
Lady Catherine either, save that she in some sort controls his
fortunes?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Cora!” I almost shrieked, seizing her hands, “what is
this? Who, who is the man? Tell me it is not George Irving
that you love, and I will fall down and worship you.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>“Why, Zana, are you wild? How should I ever think of
another, and he in my heart always?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“He—who? Speak, girl, or I shall indeed be wild!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You act very strangely, Zana. Only now you told me that
you had seen Mr. Morton, and talked with him; you gave so
many painful hints about him.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I seized her hands again, and forced down the tremulous hope
in my heart.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Cora, darling Cora,” I said, interrupting my words with
quick gasps of breath, that I had no power to stifle, “tell me
clearly, use few words, or my heart will break with this
suspense. Was the man with whom you left Greenhurst Henry
Morton?”</p>

<p class='c014'>My emotion terrified her. She grew pale, and struggled to
free her hands.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You know it was; are you going crazy? My fingers—my
fingers, you crush them.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And it was Morton?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes—yes!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And you have no love for Irving? He never said, never
hinted that he wished you to love him?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“He—no. Who ever put the idea into your head?”</p>

<p class='c014'>I seized her in my embrace, and covered her forehead, her
eyes, her hair, with rapturous kisses. I knelt at her feet, and
wrung her little hand in my ecstasy till she cried out with the
anguish.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Kiss me, Cora, again, again; kneel down here, Cora, at
my side, and thank God as I do. We shall be happy, darling,
so happy—my head reels with the very thought of it—my heart
is so full. Let me weep myself still here—here on my knees,
with my forehead in your lap. Cora, Cora, it seems to me that
I am dying!”</p>

<p class='c014'>And now the tears came rushing up from the depths of my
heart, and I lay upon Cora’s lap, sobbing the agony of my old
grief away, as a half-drowned man lies upon the beach where
the storm has tossed him. Oh, how great was the wealth of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>my existence that moment. Irving did not love another; he
was mine, mine, all mine!</p>

<p class='c014'>Chaleco came in and interrupted us. He inquired the cause
of my emotion, and I told him. The tiger that my first words
brought to his eyes, crouched and cowered beneath the energy
of my entreaties to be freed from the pledge I had given to
bury myself with his tribe in Granada. In passion like mine
there is almost irresistible eloquence, and my soul was burning
with it. Perhaps I looked more like my mother, thus enkindled
and aroused.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Zana,” he said, and the first tears I ever saw in his fierce
eyes, burned there like a diamond. “Zana, you ask a terrible
thing. Like your mother, I swore a vow to Papita. You love
my enemy and hers; you cling to him and cast the gipsy
aside. But even better than that, I loved her and her child.
I give up my oath of vengeance. What is death, if Aurora’s
child may live and love?” Chaleco went out; afterwards I remembered
all the force of his words, but then my soul panted
for solitude and thought. I spent the night alone, sleepless
and happy as few mortals have the capacity of being on this
earth.</p>

<p class='c014'>I knew little, and cared nothing for the propriety of conventional
life. On the day before, I had promised to return for
Lady Catherine’s final answer to the proposal I had in my
ignorance made. I went and inquired, not for her, but for
Irving.</p>

<p class='c014'>He came down to receive me, looking pale and depressed.
His reception was cold, his look constrained.</p>

<p class='c014'>To this day I cannot tell what passed between us during
that interview. All that was in my heart I poured forth. I
remember his astonishment and his rapture. But of what was
said I have no distinct idea; all was a whirl, a vortex of emotion.</p>

<p class='c014'>A silence that seemed like heaven followed, and then we
began to talk more rationally. Oh, the exquisite happiness of
that entire confidence—the beautiful, beautiful joy of knowing
that I was his affianced wife, the only person he had ever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>loved! In the first sweet outgush of confidence, I told him
everything. He seemed shocked and greatly surprised at
Morton’s perfidy; but when I told him of Upham, and the
power he had exercised over our lives, by the cruel suspicions
instilled into my belief, his indignation was so mingled with
sovereign contempt of the man’s pretensions, that he laughed
while denouncing him.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Poor fool,” he said, “doubtless by some means he had
obtained a knowledge of your heirship during our residence at
my uncle’s hunting lodge, where we spent several seasons. He
is a shrewd man, our new rector. But Morton, I cannot think
so badly of him. Believe me, Zana, there is some explanation
behind all this. Morton is a reserved, perhaps irresolute man
in some things, but I cannot think him base, though there was
a time when I thought otherwise.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And when was that?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It was rumored, Zana, that he had brought a companion
with him to Scotland. I heard of your disappearance from
Greenhurst at the same time, and believed you to be the inmate
of that little farm-house. My mother joined in that belief.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Poor Cora,” I said, “the odium of her fault seems all to
rest on me, her best friend.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Let us wait before we condemn my friend,” said Irving,
generously. “In his situation of unjust dependence may be
found, perhaps, some excuse for all this. Believe me, dear one,
Morton is not a dishonorable man.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“He is at any rate the rightful owner of Marston Court,” I
answered; “but with your leave, he shall only take possession
of it as Cora’s marriage portion.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Irving smiled, and then we began to talk of ourselves again.
He drew me close to his side, bent his flushed face to mine,
and whispered a thousand sweet words that have little meaning,
except to the one heart, which receives them like drops of
honey-dew. In our great happiness we did not notice that the
door had opened, and Lady Catherine stood in the entrance
coolly regarding us.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>We arose together, his arm still around me, his flushed face
becoming serious and calm. “Mother,” he said, “receive
Zana kindly, for this morning she has promised to be my wife.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Your wife! and is there no other way?” faltered the
haughty woman; “must this sacrifice be made?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Sacrifice!” exclaimed Irving, looking down upon me with a
glance of proud affection; “why, mother, I have loved the child
from the first moment I saw her protecting that deer so bravely.
It was this love which rendered it impossible for me to marry
another.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The great love in my heart brought with it a gentle humility
unknown to my nature before. I withdrew myself from Irving’s
arm, and went up to his mother, blushing and with tears in my
eyes.</p>

<p class='c014'>“O, Lady Catherine, do not look so coldly on your son.
Love me a little for his sake.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She reached forth her hand, drew me toward her, and with
a regal bend of the head, kissed my cheek.</p>

<p class='c014'>“My son,” she said, resigning herself gracefully to the inevitable,
“my son, you see that a mother can make sacrifices,
even though her child may refuse them.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Before Irving could express the gratitude that broke from
his eyes at this unexpected concession, Lady Catherine had withdrawn
from the room. Then I remembered how long my own
stay had been, and hastened with breathless shame to the hackney
coach that still waited for me at the door.</p>

<p class='c014'>The day was beautiful, and I dismissed the carriage, resolved
to walk awhile before entering our lodgings. As I turned a corner
a gentleman passed me hurriedly, turned back, and spoke,</p>

<p class='c014'>“Zana,” he cried—“Zana, I have met you at last; let me
hope you are disposed to recognize me as a friend, at least.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I was too happy for indignation, otherwise his audacity would
have met with a sharp rebuke. Emboldened by this gentleness,
he moved on at my side, pouring forth a torrent of low-voiced
protestations. A spirit of mischief seized upon me, and I
answered him with playful evasions. He evidently was quite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>ignorant that the secret of my legitimacy, doubtless so long
known to himself, was in my possession.</p>

<p class='c014'>“In a few days,” he said, impressively, “I shall be enabled to
claim you before the whole world. I have already taken orders,
and am now going to render Lady Clare my thanks for the
Marston Court living.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I felt a smile quivering on my lips; for the first time the consciousness
that my inheritance had endowed me with power,
came with force to my heart.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It will be a useless visit,” I said, very quietly. “Lady Clare
withdraws the promise she has made. A man who has so long
practised deceit and falsehood, is no proper person to lead
others on their way to heaven. Let me answer you, Mr.
Upham, the Marston Court Rectory will receive another incumbent
than yourself.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He stood aghast, looking at me. “But the living is as good
as mine already. I have even notified the curate at Greenhurst
to leave the parsonage.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No doubt; but if he leaves Greenhurst it will most certainly
be to take possession of the Marston Court Rectory.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Upham forced a laugh.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You speak positively for Lady Clare!” he said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I speak simply for myself, Mr. Upham.”</p>

<p class='c014'>That instant I reached the door of our lodgings and went in,
leaving my clerical friend in a bewildered state on the sidewalk.</p>

<p class='c014'>I entered the little parlor, expecting to find Cora there alone,
but to my astonishment young Morton arose from the sofa where
she was seated, and came toward me, a little pale and anxious,
but with more dignity than I had ever witnessed in him before.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Zana,” he said, “I have just come down from Scotland in
search of this dear runaway!”</p>

<p class='c014'>I drew back, annoyed. Both his manner and words offended
me.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, tell her, tell her at once!” cried Cora, springing up,
with a face like an April day, all flush, tears and smiles. “Tell
her it was your wife who ran away from you, like a naughty,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>wicked, jealous little wretch, as she was. Zana, dear Zana, we
were married all the time, but I had promised him, and could
not tell, you know, because he was quite sure that Lady Catherine
never would have given up any of the property, if she found
out that he had fallen in love with such a poor, foolish-hearted
little good-for-nothing as I was. There, Mr. Morton, do sit
down and tell her all about it. Remember she is Lady Clare
now, the best, most generous, the—the—well, well; no matter
if I am wild, that awful secret is off my heart; I feel like a bird.
Oh, if I had but wings to fly away and tell my blessed, blessed
papa.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Morton sat down upon the sofa, gathering that beautiful
young wife to his bosom, and hushing her into quiet with his
silent caresses.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It was wrong and cowardly, I know,” he said, “but we
were both madly in love, with no one to heed us. Lady Catherine
was determined that I should follow her to Scotland, where
she promised to have papers prepared, returning a portion of
my old uncle Morton’s estate to me. Separation seemed dreadful
to us both. It was a wild, rash act; but I persuaded Cora
to come with me, forgetting all the evil that might spring from
concealment, and afraid of Lady Catherine’s displeasure, for she
seemed anxious for some excuse to delay the transfer. I persuaded
Cora to conceal our marriage, and stay quietly in the
old farm-house, till Lady Catherine’s caprices could no longer
affect us; but my visits were necessarily few, for some vague
rumor of her presence in Scotland reached Lady Catherine, and
I was compelled to be cautious. The poor child grew restless,
sad, and at last doubtful of my integrity. She was pining herself
to death when you found her, and innocently completed her
belief in my faithlessness.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I had made up my mind to brave everything, and avow
that she was my wife, on the very day that Cora left Scotland.
It was a desolate reception that the old people gave me. Cora,
I could feel for the loneliness of your father, then.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>“Let us go—let us go to him!” cried Cora, starting up, “it
will never be quite heaven till we get home.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Not yet, wait a little, and we will all go together,” I said,
turning to leave the room, and without waiting for a reply, I
stole away, leaving those two young hearts with each other, too
full of my own exquisite happiness for anything but the selfishness
of solitude.&#160;*&#160;*&#160;*&#160;*&#160;*</p>

<p class='c014'>We entered Greenhurst quietly, and after nightfall, Lady
Catherine, Cora, Moreton and myself. Irving was to follow us
in a few days, but Chaleco, to whom I had given all Papita’s
gold for the use of his tribe, remained behind. We drew up
at the parsonage. The curtains of the parlor were drawn apart,
and sitting in the twilight within, was the shadowy presence of
a man stooping downward, in sorrow or thoughtfulness, as if
the position had become habitual.</p>

<p class='c014'>Cora drew close to her husband, and by the faint light I could
see her eyes dilate and darken with excitement. She saw that
shadowy presence and struggled forward, pushing impotently
at the carriage door with both hands, and crying out—</p>

<p class='c014'>“My father! my father!”</p>

<p class='c014'>The shadow gathered itself suddenly up, and opening the
window, called out in a low, wild voice:—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Who calls? who calls? did some one say father?”</p>

<p class='c014'>The carriage door sprang open, Cora leaped to the ground,
sped like a bird up the walk, and disappeared in the porch.
Directly, there came a strange sound through the open window—mingled
sobs, caresses, and holy fragments of prayer, broken
up with gushes of thanksgiving. Morton fell back in the carriage.
I saw him cover his face with both hands, and felt that
he trembled.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Heaven forgive me!” he muttered “heaven forgive me
the misery I have caused this good man!”</p>

<p class='c014'>I was looking toward the parlor. Mr. Clark had fallen
back in his chair, and Cora was bending over him. His face
was like that of a glorified saint. His lips moved, but gave
<span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>forth nothing but broken smiles. Cora fell forward, embracing
his knees. Her beautiful face was uplifted like Guido’s Hope,
but with a shadow of penitent sorrow upon it.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Father! father!”</p>

<p class='c014'>He stooped forward and folded the sweet, tearful face to his
bosom, tenderly as the mother hushes her grieved infant.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Bless thee, oh, my child! The God of heaven bless thee!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Faithful to the holy type of Christianity, the good man was
ready to forgive with the first breath of concession, even without
knowing the extent of her fault.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Father, you forgive us; see, it is my husband; I am very,
very happy, father.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Weary with our long journey, and overcome with emotion,
Cora flung her arms around that honored neck; and just as her
husband came up, fainted quite away on her father’s bosom.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Give her to me, sir,” said Morton, approaching the group,
pale and agitated; “I am her husband, and with her pray
your forgiveness.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The young husband faltered; the good man looked up, with
every feature of his face in commotion.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Take her, then,” he said, placing his child in Morton’s arms;
“I have only blessings to give—tears and blessings for you
both.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Morton carried his wife to the dear old couch of white
dimity, which made my heart throb as I looked that way. A
few moments restored her to consciousness.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is Zana who brings us back—bless Zana, father!” she
said, faintly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Zana,” he exclaimed, bending over me with touching
solemnity, and pressing both palms on my head, as in the olden
times; “God bless thee, forever and ever, Zana!”</p>

<p class='c014'>The very touch of those hands, quivering with joy, was a
benediction. His tears fell upon my forehead, the holy tears
of a Christian heart broken up with tenderness. I could not
speak, but with this new baptism on my brow, entered upon
my inheritance.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>My inheritance! yes. We drove to Greenhurst, for such was
Lady Catherine’s wish, but I would not enter. While the servants
were busy receiving her, unconscious of a new mistress, I
stole off and flew like a bird to my old home. The moon
was up, and I could see my way through the wilderness and
across the garden, but here I paused with checked breath, for
in the midst, still sheltered by trees and shadowed with vines,
stood the cottage, darkened and solitary, as if every living
thing had deserted it.</p>

<p class='c014'>With a heavier tread, I went round the house to our old sitting
room. Here a gleam of light stole out upon the vines,
and through the window I saw Turner and his wife sitting
drearily together. She was looking in his face. His eyes
were turned on the blank wall, as if he did not care to receive
even her sympathy.</p>

<p class='c014'>I opened the door and stood within it attempting to speak,
but with no power. Maria started up.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Zana! Zana!”</p>

<p class='c014'>I flung myself on her bosom. She smothered me with her
kisses, while blessed old Turner stood pleading for one look at
my face, that he might be sure it was his child.</p>

<p class='c014'>We sat up all night. Not once alone, but twenty times, I
was forced to repeat the romance I had been living. Over and
over again they told me how heartbroken they were when old
Jupiter came back with his empty saddle, and bridle trailing in
the dust. For weeks old Turner had searched for me. For
months he had done nothing but mourn. Jupiter had pined
like the rest. My absence had flung everything into shadow.</p>

<p class='c014'>But I was home again—home again—not for a time, but for
all the days of my life—the mistress of Greenhurst and the
betrothed wife of Irving. Turner kept repeating this over and
over, as he walked up and down the room. He could not
realize it. In truth, I think he did not quite admit all the facts
to his belief, till he saw me cantering off on Jupiter’s back the
next morning. Dear old Ju, what a glorious ride we had
over the uplands that day!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER LVI.<br> <span class='large'>THE OLD TOWER CHAMBER.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>It was my bridal morning. I sat within my own pretty
chamber, for from the cottage that had been my first shelter,
not from the mansion which was only my inheritance, I
resolved that Irving should take his bride. For the first time
in my life I was clad in pure white. No summer cloud was ever
more soft and vapory than the flow of my robe. The bridal
veil, crowned by a garland of pale blush roses, fell like a web
of exquisite frost-work around me. Pearls gleamed like hail-stones
amid the snow of this dress, and a single white rose-bud,
hidden in moss, gathered its cloudiness over my bosom.</p>

<p class='c014'>Cora and my blessed old bonne had done this fairy work,
and I was not to see myself till the toilet was complete. At
last they led me up to the mirror. As I looked in, a faint pang
seized me, for the whiteness of my dress struck inward, and
drifts of snow seemed crowding against my heart. A vague
dread of some unseen presence brought the old shudder upon
me. I looked around in chill apprehension for my mother’s
face. As I turned, a gush of sunshine come through the pink
and white window-curtains, flooding me from head to foot with
its rosy glow. I felt the brightness and the warmth. For one
instant it seemed to me that my mother’s soft eyes looked upon
me through the floating haze. My heart swelled again. A
smile sprang to my lips. The coldness had forever departed
from my bosom. The chill of my mother’s death was quenched
in the glory of my new life.</p>

<p class='c014'>The sound of bells sweeping up through the beautiful morning
came to my chamber, filling my soul with a sweet tranquillity.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>On this day began the calm of my life. I went forth
garlanded with bridal roses, on which the dew still rested, and
with old Turner by my side rode to the church along the
road where the wedding of my father and the funeral of his
bride had passed by me, a poor gipsy beggar, lying sick and
dizzy, with returning life in the open field. I thought of all
this with gentle sadness, but it could not reach the heaven in
my heart. The iron thread had melted away from the gold of
my destiny. The altar was graced with roses that made the
air fragrant with their breath, as we knelt before it. Mr.
Clark, that day appointed rector of Marston Court, clasped
our hands together before it, and sent us forth into the beautiful
eternity of our love.</p>

<p class='c014'>Marston and Cora, the new lord and lady of Marston Court,
stood by, regarding us with gentle affection, while lady
Catherine, yielding to her own interests, but half reconciled at
heart, looked down in sovereign pride on Mr. Turner, from
whose hands her high-born son was willing to receive his bride,
for who else had the right to give me away?</p>

<p class='c014'>As we turned from the altar, I saw, at the lower end of the
church, the dark face of Chaleco. He was looking at me with
a wild, mournful expression, that seemed more sombre from the
shadows in which he stood. He answered my smile, which
invited him to approach, with a moody wave of the head; but
as we went down the aisle, he came toward us.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Zana,” he said, in a hoarse whisper, “if these people wrong
you, if in all things they do not regard Aurora’s child as a
queen, send the ruby ear-rings to Chaleco. During a few months
he will be with his people, and even after he is gone the man
or woman who offends you shall feel their vengeance.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, there will be no need,” I answered, regarding my husband
with a heart swell; “but for yourself, Chaleco, my more
than friend, for your people—yours and mine, count—remember
that a portion of all the wealth you have won for us must each
year go to them.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The gipsy count grasped my hand hard, his eyes sparkled, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>uttered a wild blessing in Rommany, and left the church before
we could urge him to join us at Greenhurst.</p>

<p class='c014'>Amid the mellow chime of bells that filled the air with rejoicings—along
a path littered with flowers, rained over it by
the village children—with the morning lighting up the earth
into a paradise, I entered Greenhurst, its mistress, yet scarcely
wishing to be that. It was enough and too much happiness for
me that I was the wife of its master.</p>

<p class='c014'>Three months after my wedding-day, I was taken with a
sudden desire to visit Marston Court. None of my old habits
had been laid aside. I still gloried in a gallop over the uplands
on Jupiter who grew young as he undertook these wild rides.
My husband was absent, and Lady Catherine now lived entirely
at Paris. It was not often that my old restless habits came on,
but this day I was haunted with a feeling that some one wanted
me at Marston Court. I had been thinking of Chaleco all day,
with a degree of anxiety which no reasoning could explain or
dispel. These haunting thoughts grew so powerful at last,
that I ordered Jupiter to be saddled. Just as I was mounting
him, a bit of paper was placed in my hand by a boy. It contained
a single sentence:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Zana, Aurora’s child, come to me.</div>
      <div class='line in32'>“<span class='sc'>Chaleco.</span>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>This message was a relief. It gave a reason for the depressing
thoughts that had driven me forth. I put my horse to his
speed, never pausing to ask what direction we should take. By
this time Marston Court was no longer a picturesque wilderness;
the gardens were almost in order; the noble trees were
free from undergrowth; the house itself princely. Leaving
my horse in the grounds, I walked across the garden to the
summer-house, through which the gipsy chief had conducted
me from the tower chamber. The mosaic star remained, with
its secret undiscovered, in the pavement. I remembered its
mechanism, and with a little force wheeled it from the opening
<span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>it concealed. The passage was dark, but a little time brought
me to a door which opened into the tower.</p>

<p class='c014'>The chamber was desolate and empty. Ashes lay on the
hearth as when we left it that night. The same drapery of
cobwebs fell in dusty festoons over the narrow windows, rendering
the room at first so dim that I could see no object distinctly.
But in an instant I caught the light of two large eyes
glaring at me from a corner; then a pale face, distorted with
pain, with the dusky outlines of a human form, reposing on what
had once been a magnificent couch. The glow of an old velvet
cushion, which still retained gleams of original crimson, was
insufficient to give a tinge of color to that pallid face, which
seemed the more deathly from contrast with the beard of iron-grey
which fell from it, like moss from a blasted tree.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Zana! Zana!” said a sharp voice from the couch.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Chaleco, my friend, my poor friend,” I cried, throwing myself
on my knees by his couch, and taking his hand, which lay so wet
and cold in my clasp, that a sudden fear came upon me that he was
dying. “Your hand freezes mine—your whole frame quivers;
what is the matter—what does this terrible prostration mean?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It means,” said Chaleco, pointing his finger to a vial that
had rolled from his hand half across the floor, where it lay
uncorked, with its purple contents oozing drop by drop from
the neck—“it means that, like Aurora, Chaleco has fulfilled
his oath. That night, Zana, when you lay in Paplta’s tent,
while the rubies burned in her ears with the color of Lady
Clare’s blood—that night, while the death throes were at her
heart, she made me swear an oath that our revenge for
Aurora’s death should be completed by the overthrow of every
living Clare; that by craft or violence I would wrest away
their wealth for our people, and make you—her last of race—a
queen at Granada; or failing, die like a poisoned dog by
this hand. As the last death-rattle left her throat she pressed
the drao into my palm. Look, you see it yonder dripping
like gouts of black blood drop by drop from the vial. From
that day I have carried it in my bosom. Zana, Zana! I have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_429'>429</span>bought your happiness with my vengeance and my life; now tell
me, on your soul—if human beings have souls—are you happy?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But for this knowledge—but for your danger—oh, heavens!
that it should have been done for me—I am happy, Chaleco.”</p>

<p class='c014'>A smile trembled over his white mouth, he reached forth his
quivering hands and, seizing my garments, drew me down to his
embrace.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Live in peace,” he said; “her fate is atoned for. It was
vengeance on them, or death to myself. I have parted with
my people. A new count reigns in my place. I had the choice
and wandered back to die with you, Zana.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, Chaleco, it was a wicked oath; sinful in the taking,
doubly sinful in the keeping.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Hush, Zana, is was that you might live free from Papita’s
curse.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I looked at him in dismay, the death shadows were gathering
on his features.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You are in great pain. Oh, my friend, is it death?” I
questioned.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Pain! yes, I might have made it the work of an instant, but
gave myself time; every moment of your presence I have
bought with a pang; but I could not die without you, Zana.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And must you die—die in this desolate place?” I said,
shuddering as his arms loosened and fell from around me.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I like this best,” said Chaleco, rising to one elbow, and
casting his glittering eyes around the room. “A Caloe count
should not die in the sun’s light, while his people grovel in the
dark earth. I am but a shadow now, Zana, fast melting away
into dark nothingness; this place is fittest.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Not so, not so, my friend!” I cried, sobbing out the grief I
most truly felt; “cast aside these terrible ideas of death—pray
to God—let me pray for you. She will help us—Aurora, whom
you loved, whom you shall surely see again.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The gipsy began to revive again. The glances of his eyes
burned into mine. His frame shook like a dead branch in
winter.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>“Zana, do you believe this?—do you believe that Aurora
lives in—in—anywhere?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I do not believe—I <em>know</em> it, certainly as I know that the
stars burn in heaven, or that the earth is solid under my feet.”</p>

<p class='c014'>His eyes grew brighter and more eager. He turned over,
grasping my hands between both his.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Zana, how am I to reach her? What can I do? Tell me—tell
me, before this coldness reaches my heart—tell me,
Zana!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Pray—pray to God.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I do not know how,” he pleaded; “it is like grasping at
mist. What shall I repeat?—which way must I turn?”</p>

<p class='c014'>The sight of that poor, helpless man would have inspired
marble with a spirit of prayer. I was upon my knees; his
quivering hands were clasped in mine. I uplifted them to
heaven with broken sobs—with tears and a burning eloquence
with which no prayer for my own soul had ever yet ascended to
heaven.</p>

<p class='c014'>As I prayed, his hands were softly withdrawn from mine. I
paused, and through the agony of my tears saw those poor
fingers tremblingly clasp around each other, and uplift themselves.
Broken words wavered on his lips. He seemed looking
at something afar off in the dim shadows of the room.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Chaleco!” I cried, in affright.</p>

<p class='c014'>His hands fell apart and dropped slowly down, touching mine,
like ice; his eyes, glazed and fireless, turned upon my face.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Aurora! Aurora!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Was it a prayer that Chaleco uttered when he gasped forth
my mother’s name? I hope so. I believe so.</p>

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
